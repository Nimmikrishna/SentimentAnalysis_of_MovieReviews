"Not for all, but for some",ZinedineElbaroni,8/10,13 March 2023,"Tenet is a cinematic masterpiece that takes you on an exciting and surprising journey through time and space. From the first scene you are immersed in a world of intrigue and danger that keeps you in suspense throughout the film. Be told. The action sequences are really good, and the visual effects are great.

The cast is phenomenal, with John David Washington giving an outstanding performance in the lead role. Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki also excel in their respective roles, bringing depth and nuance to their characters.

But what sets Tenet apart is his sheer ambition. This is a movie that demands your full attention and rewards you for it. Challenge.

In short, Tenet is a love letter to cinema, an exhilarating ride that pushes the boundaries of what is possible on screen. If you're looking for a breathtaking film that keeps you pondering its mysteries long after the credits roll, look no further than Tenet."
Damned good try,xyqkp,7/10,10 March 2023,"Putting aside the ham-handed effort to explain the physics, which was unavoidable since it's clear no physicist was ever asked to look at the plausibility of the script, the overall premise wasn't awful. The first 30-45 minutes quite muddled the premise by trying to create suspense where there was no need for any yet; choosing to open with a James Bond spy ambience was the wrong choice. And, oddly, in the end the very premise itself completely eliminated any suspense in the ending (because, we knew the world wasn't going to be deleted, so we knew almost to the smallest detail what was going to happen). That's not really a failure on this movie's fault; such circuitous and ""destiny"" oriented premises always run that risk. With such premises you need to look for suspense in some fashion other than the question of whether destiny is real or not. The ""destroy everything or nothing"" premise could not be the key suspense point. If, for example, they'd focused the critical ending question of where the protagonist and the girl would get together, they'd have posed a question that could go either way ... and therefore been suspenseful. I've only ever seen one ""end of the world"" movie where focus successfully stayed on whether the world would end or not ... and surprisingly, it did ... and then more surprisingly, it didn't.

Clearly a WHOLE lot of effort was put into thinking through the visual implications of forward/backward time travel. Some very inventive chase and fight scenes, and especially seeing the same sequences played out first in forward time and then again later in reverse time. A huge scripting effort and an even greater, monumental continuity effort. Unfortunately, as one might expect for a task this large and complex, there were quite a few perspective failures. But, perhaps, the greatest failure was in audio. Faces covered in masks (perhaps a bit stupid overkill-one asks why air needed to be reversed when literally nothing else in the forward world needed to be) are fine visualizations, but in a movie this fast paced, all I can say is I'm damned glad I streamed it so I could go back over and over again: in a theater, mumbled clues to a complex story like this is the same thing as not bother to explain anything. People can't concentrate the necessary effort for two hours on hearing, listening, and understanding without getting migraines. The movie was clearly not shown to anyone not already familiar with the premise before editing was complete. The movie would gone up 2 ratings on IMDB if people had actually heard and understood the details of the premise and its implications, but alas far too many reviews were posted here by people who either couldn't spend the effort to understand or wouldn't.

Any time you combine a frenzied presentation with a complex premise like time travel with no meaningful opportunity to pause and think, you're just going to lose your audience along the way. And while there were a huge number of time-travel nuances in the closing scenes, I wager most people missed at least half of them.

Perhaps I'm a bit of an elitist in thinking I did get them and many others didn't, but that's not exactly the way to maximize your profits making a movie."
bloated & pretentious,Chris_Ego,2/10,9 March 2023,"I have to admit crashing a real plane with practical effects was a highlight, but this doesn't make ""Tenet"" a good action movie. I'd say it's Nolands worst project since this film tries so hard to be unique it gets lost in the sands of its own time. When ""Tenet"" was released in 2020 everybody was hyped about the way how the reverse footage was shot. This is interesting but doesn't look convincing all the time. The fight at the airport is tedious and unwillingly funny, especially when the SWAT like guys are crawling backwards on the floor making funny shoe noises like they played basketball on the school court. The first hour goes by fast and so much happens in this time yet little I did understand. They keep talking too much too fast and Blondie is whispering when she is the one spreading important clues. Nolan fails to star the ""Protagonist"" in a likeable way and therefor the film just presses on without any connection to the lead. Robert Pattinson did a nice job as his sidekick Neil and I am so looking forward to see him starring the ""Batman"". Oops, I lost it there. Yeah, Tenet is a waste of your precious watching time."
Tall Drink of Water,sure_man,4/10,8 March 2023,"Although this was victimized by COVID, even after an impressive pre-release marketing campaign, the film is just not that good. A classic B-movie with an A-level budget, frenetic (bordering on incoherent) editing and a silly spin on searching for horcruxes (reference intended), the moebius strip time spin just didn't really work. Maybe the bonding agents are on the editing room floor somewhere, but I'm sure the book not based on the movie is much for fulfilling and illuminates the internal workings of the characters beyond ""save my child"" and ""I hate life so I'm taking everyone with me"". This is comic book level stuff for a work alleging to be of substance. The character motivations are ridiculously thin and cliched. Much of the monotone dialogue lacks punch and vitality. For all the pretension, this is nothing more than smoke and mirrors."
A Mind-Bending and Spectacular Spy Thriller,FilmFanatic2023,8/10,4 March 2023,"Tenet is a sci-fi action film directed by Christopher Nolan that revolves around a secret agent who uses time inversion to prevent a global catastrophe. The film is a dazzling display of Nolan's signature style, featuring stunning visuals, complex plot twists, and thrilling action sequences. The film also explores themes of free will, fate, and entropy. John David Washington leads the cast as the Protagonist, a charismatic and skilled spy who teams up with Neil (Robert Pattinson), a mysterious ally. Kenneth Branagh plays Andrei Sator, a ruthless Russian oligarch who seeks to destroy the world.

I enjoyed Tenet for its ambitious and original concept, its impressive cinematography, its exhilarating pace, and its clever dialogue. I think Christopher Nolan delivered another masterpiece that challenges and entertains the audience. I would recommend Tenet to fans of sci-fi who appreciate a fast-paced and intricate film that requires multiple viewings to fully understand."
Another masterpiece crafted by the one and only Christopher Nolan,Nicholas_HY,10/10,20 February 2023,"My only regret was not watching this in the theatres. Well, streaming this has its own advantages like you can rewind and watch the specific scene's ""before and after."" I find that most of the bad reviews talk about the plot and while I agree that the plot will be confusing for a majority of the people but once you get a grasp of it you will awe and appreciate this even more. Even the soundtrack was just perfect for this movie, I'm actually glad that Nolan didn't use Zimmer for this project because his style wasn't suitable. While the action sequences are decent, I'd recommend this movie for its story and plot because I myself enjoys a good intricate mystery/thriller stuffs. Nolan is truly one of the best of our time."
Another amazing film by Christopher Nolan,Reviewosaurus,9/10,19 February 2023,"After a near-death experience during a CIA operation, the Protagonist is recruited to join a government organization called Tenet, tasked with preventing World World III. The time inversion aspect of the film was so interesting and different; I've never seen anything like it in another film. You will probably be confused throughout the movie, but by the end, everything comes together. I like how the characters were portrayed and written, but one thing I felt this movie was lacking was a solid antagonist. I love this film, it's mind-blowing, gripping, and thought-provoking, and I would highly recommend it."
Worth to watch,giedriavas,8/10,17 February 2023,"A film will discover both fans and those who will enjoy less. Nolan is trying to apply the ideas we saw in his previous fantastic films,but also discovered something new - what is worth seeing in cinema and seeing more than once at home. Without telling the story of the film,one can only ask questions - what if onr way or another ? So the film is kind of divided into two parts. It is necessary and possible to watch from the very first minutes and you will get into the story perfectly. Fun to see know or lesser known actors ,becouse in the movie a lot of action,well that charisma was even more. After movie the music track was not known to me,but when i heard it in cinema after movie..damn... the whirlwinds were walking for generations."
A movie that bit more than it could chew,dargosmunteanu,8/10,17 February 2023,"The concept behind Tenet is a very interesting one, but also very difficult to implement in a movie and probably even more important, vaguely explained and expanded upon throughout the runtime. That last bit is probably its downfall, stated rules that govern its function aren't consistently abided by, making the whole adventure sketchy at best.

Acting was good, action scenes were interesting, the story could've been solid if the whole time-traveling mechanic would've been treated in a more traditional manner.

It may not have ended up being a high concept sci-fi movie, but it would've been a more consistent and, overall, ejoyable long (yeah, a bit too long, maybe?) cinematic experience.

Worth the watch, but it may require of you to fill in a lot of blanks that the writers and technology left within it."
Phantasy of a genius director but a plain movie,furkankilickap,8/10,14 February 2023,"Christopher Nolan's filmography has, in my view, a registered position in the history of cinema; however, with this movie Nolan cannot carry himself further when we compare Tenet with his former works, most of which had box office-recorded movies.

There is an unique idea about ""time inverting"" but the idea is not fit on the action based story which has full of cliches. Concept of inverting can be easy to understand from the perspective of Nolan undoubtedly, but I'm sure that audience may have difficulty to understand the idea scene by scene upon the actions of the characters or from the story because action genre has fast-paced storytelling; nonetheless, you can get the idea and what Nolan is trying to say in general. So I agree with some critics saying that Nolan made this movie just for himself.

Besides, background of the characters are empty unfortunately. You cannot feel empathy for the protagonist or cannot understand the motivation of some characters to a certain extent but performances of actresses & actors quite well - especially John David Washington.

From cinematographic and musical perspectives, the movie makes real the atmosphere and the world. For the last five years Hoyte Van Hoytema (DP) and Ludwig Göransson (composer) have the names proved themselves in their professions, and they deserve some credits specifically for this movie.

Although Tenet has full of bad criticism according to a stereotypical action based movie, you can feel the magical and dazzling touch of a master director with an idea that wasn't thought before. Therefore, the movie deserves to be watched & a score above average.

TRIVIA: Contains no green screens, just practical effects. This includes the inversion sequences, for which director Christopher Nolan chose instead to shoot each scene twice: one time moving forward, and once with the actors doing everything backward. (BIND BLOWING DIRECTING 101)"
Loud and impenetrable,Quinoa_Chris_Kirk,1/10,8 February 2023,"A man on an international mission to save the world from the deadliest weapon of all, the future.

Two moods: excessive incomprehensible exposition and LOUD incomprehensible action sequences. At no point do you know what is going on, nor are you given any reason to care. It is at all times tedious, meaningless and irritating. None of the characters are remotely interesting, much of the dialogue is inaudible and the ridiculous convolutions add up to nothing. And this cost over $200 million to make.

Here Nolan has retreated deeply, unpleasantly and unforgivably into his own idiosyncrasy and left his loyal audience scrambling to come up with excuses for him."
Didn't finish watching it !!!,jayydee3,5/10,5 February 2023,"The main actor is not great. Mumbles his words, his appearance doesn't fit in with the people he is dealing with and no class. Not a James Bond type at all. The story was confusing and and far too long to keep your attention. Not exciting and certainly not believable as far as the main actor went. I think it had the makings of a very good file if the casting had been different in the main roles. This turned out to be just a mess. I got to the point that I just couldn't watch it any further and turned it off. Could have been much better with some more experienced actors and a better script. All in all very poorly done movie."
Too clever for its own good - just as another reviewer said,kambomambos,2/10,5 February 2023,"Had potential but way too complicated. Had to watch with subtitles and continuously rewind to work out what was going on - even then we were unclear. If it was simplified a little and the dialogue made clearer (in every way) it would have been much more enjoyable. Put aside an extra hour for stopping and rewinding if you're gonna watch this one.

Well acted and characters were solid but if you can't hear what they are saying, particularly when they are talking non-sensical physics and time travel it's very difficult to follow. Good cast, great effects but without clarity it's unfortunately a frustrating waste of three hours."
basic premise is stupid,cleeds-27588,1/10,31 January 2023,"The basic premise is that a scientist in the future invents time reversing devices, regrets her invention as too dangerous, so instead of destroying it she decides to send them back in time to out present, where a mad Russian oligarch somehow discovers all this and decides to use the invention to destroy the present world because we are destroying the environment - quite how or why he thought this would work is never mentioned, because it is too ridiculous. That, or we just have to accept that he is mad, or the future people told him it was the only way. He does it because he is dying and his madness makes him think if he can't live then no one else can either - or something. It is not clear which, so pick'n'mix as you like. Time travel movies never work. Never. Basically it's an excuse for a lot of Bond style fist fights, explosions, crashes, car chases, random violence. As with Bond, the baddie has an unending supply of incredibly gullible and stupid helpers all over the world who are quite happy to be killed and maimed on his behalf, and set off these devices on command from the baddie as he lounges on his mega-yacht. Just terrible."
"In a few words, a waste of time...",jesusroblesazul,5/10,31 January 2023,"Well, I could suffer much more with this absurd movie, but i was enough wise to avoid the suffering. Why people try to understand garbage like this? When at a first sight you can see the final result: a protagonist without personality, scenes plenty of unnecessary violence, excess of special effects, and at last an clumsy attempt to make up the mediocrity of the film using some well known actors with no results. I can accept mister Nolan isa very distinguished director. In fact, I enjoy very much most oh his work, but this time, what Can I say: this work is a failure in many ways, a very boring movie in despite of all the action the director adds at any moment. Anyway, a waste of time..."
My head hurts,benpulford-82589,10/10,29 January 2023,"I've watched many great films that the more I watch, the more I understand the plot. But, with this film, the less I understand it!!! Why? Why? Why? How the heck did Meister Nolan get this past the producers? Not that I'm complaining. It truly is a great, great film. It's just...that it defies all logic. Is Christopher Nolan from the future? I was intrigued to note there is a reference to Oppenheimer in the film and as we no know Nolan is making / has been making a bio-pic about Oppenheimer. Or is that statement a spolier? Is a spolier a spolier if it's written in the future about the past? Or is it - is a spolier a spolier if it's written in the past about the future? My head hurts...for all the right reasons. Very much looking forward to Oppenheimer!"
"For all its ambition, 'Tenet' is a mushy glob of nonsense.",punch_p,3/10,29 January 2023,"This summer, in anticipation of the release of Tenet, I wrote a piece defending the position of Christopher Nolan as not merely a filmmaker of huge commercial clout, but as someone whose quality of work on an artistic, cinematographic, and emotional (yes, I wrote that!) level merits proper appreciation too. I did post a warning though that Nolan's increasing reverence for tech and his control freak tendencies were threatening to outweigh that lovely dichotomy he had always been able to blend between all things genre and his metaphysically-inflected narratives.

With Tenet, Nolan totally oversteps that line and has turned in a work that runs dangerously close to self-satire. While I would argue his previous ten films have always possessed some portion of an emotional edge amid the viscerality of their storytelling, Tenet is, simply, a spectatorial dead weight. It is completely lacking in tension and is just a film endlessly stuck in the cycle of explaining and justifying itself and its conceit (perhaps an unintended, ironic echo of its central theme of inversion). Copious exposition is nothing new to a Nolan film, but comprehensiblity and an emotional core always co-existed with that philosophical bent. Even Memento - a film which loosely echoes the tricks of Tenet with a focus on a narrative being played in reverse - was able to conjure three-dimensional character arcs out of those thematics. In Tenet, however, the characters remain (unintentionally) flat, which is borne out when the Protagonist's climactic conversation with Neil and his one last look at Kat don't carry the dramatic pay-off Nolan is clearly angling for.

Even in Nolan's lesser guise as a purveyor of spectacle, Tenet falls flat. For all the lustre, gravitas and awe Nolan applies to his action sequences (I'm thinking about the exploding jumbo, the billionaire's yacht, the racing boats), he's unable to aestheticise these for his audience the way his idol, Michael Mann, can. It's because Mann's action scenes are always connected to the ethics and emotion of his stories, whereas Nolan's function as extraneous gorging on extreme financial, technological and industrial might."
Whoa...if you thought 'Inception' was mind-blowing...just wait!,cochrandarin,8/10,29 January 2023,"Ok, I had to watch Inception about 3 times to, uh, get it. You'll have to watch this one about five. The concept is mind-blowing with the whole inversion of time and reversed entropy through the continium, or...something like that. Basically, folks in the future have figured out how to send something traveling backwards through time. So, future bullets that have already been fired are sent spiraling backwards and end up back in the magazine of the gun someone is holding before they've even fired it. If that sounds complicated, just wait till cars and humans start going backwards. The complex part is when they all start meeting themselves and the plot folds and unfolds...is revisited...is changed...is observed by their other selves just across the battlefield...etc. Etc. Etc...you get the picture. All the while, our hero (who is not named and is just referred to as the 'Protagonist') is trying to thwart this dangerous technology, which has obviously ended up in the wrong hands, from destroying the world. Not by sending a nuke back into the hands of Hitler and the SS, but even worse; Using some kinda complicated math algorithm to create a doomsday bomb. Or at least I THINK that's what he was doing. I tried to tell my 9th grade Calculus teacher that not only was math useless, turns out IT's DANGEROUS!!

Anyhow, the acting is great. The lead guy does good. Robert Pattinson from Twilight fame, is the lead character's, uh...side-kick and he does just fine. Elizabeth Dibicki does great as the...well, it's complicated. You'll just have to watch and figure it out for yourself. The truth is, you could say that about most of this movie. The plot is so complex and quick-moving that we found ourselves rewinding many times to review a line here and there that was important to what was going on. I think I'm a fairly smart guy, I have a doctorate and even an undergrad bachelor of science degree. I have even written a sci-fi book, so I thought I would 'get it' maybe a little better than the average fella walking through Walmart that works as an auto mechanic (no offense to that line of work) but even I felt myself raising an eyebrow many times while watching this movie. It's so confusing at times that I even asked my bunch; ""How many average folks would have turned this off by now?""

It's not to say that it isn't entertaining. It's definitely original and the special effects are beyond mind-blowing and it redefines the phrase ""plot twists""!

So, give it a try and be prepared to plan on watching again, and maybe again. Grab a plate of chocolate chip cookies and pull up a sofa by the fire on a weekend night with the fam when you got nothing stressful on your mind to distract you. You'll definitely need a clear head to try and navigate through this one.

Enjoy...."
Nolan really wants us to believe he is a genius,LawrenceLambleg,5/10,29 January 2023,"I'm honestly baffled how could a director with an incredible debut like Memento go so far down his own rabbit holes.

Plot - pretty original and very cool concepts, but so poorly executed. Whatever works in this movie is quickly ruined by exposition.

Pacing - too much action, too much dialogue you keep missing because of loud music and too much noise. They tried to cram so much stuff in two and a half hours and this movie could easily do without half of its content.

Dialogue - there are no characters in this movie. The only purpose of every character is to tell you where the plot is going, just in case you were too stupid to figure it out. So there's no dialogue really. Just Nolan holding the viewer's hand through this mess of a movie through different characters. So when the characters speak to each other, it feels like you're watching the director's commentary rather than an actual movie.

Acting - both Pattinson and Michael Caine are wasted here. Washington doesn't have a character. His character doesn't even have a name, he is called ""The Protagonist"" and the big plot twist of this movie is that he IS in fact THE PROTAGONIST. Bravo, Nolan! Kenneth Brannagh plays every Russian villain you've ever seen in campy 80s and 90s action movies. He is the worst thing about this movie in my opinion. If they hired someone better to play Sator, I would've at least had some motivation to sit through the movie. It's not most of the actors' fault that they don't have actual characters to work with, but Kenneth Brannagh really screws this up.

The ol' switcheroo of continuity - the entire second half of this movie is just one big continuity error. This is probably the most unforgivable crime that this movie commits. Nolan seems to just switch the reversal of time on and off to make this contrived plot work. You see the entire world supposedly go into reverse, but all of the characters are moving forwards in time so you can follow the actual plot, even the ones that aren't ""inverted"". If they really committed to the time reversal, it would've been beautiful, but no... characters keep ""inverting"" themselves for the sake of comprehensive storytelling. You watch the movie, then you get confused by something that doesn't make sense and a character appears not a second later to tell you ""ah, you see... I inverted myself back then... so now I'm dead, but actually I was dead..."" Yeah, sure... You really wanna blow us away, Nolan? Don't do a half-assed attempt at time-reversal where everybody talks and walks normal. Make the second half actually reversed... It would've been way better to be confusing, rather than just pretending to be clever. The movie explicitly tells you ""don't try to understand it"" and then feels the need to keep explaining itself to you for two hours... In its best moments this movie had no exposition. If Nolan lets things just happen without any pointless explanation, I think his movies would've been way better than they are."
It's different,thisisstepercival,6/10,27 January 2023,"Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly a great filmmaker, although personally I find his films very hit and miss - The Dark Knight is outstanding and even played as a straight cops and robbers movie instead of a superhero film that still stands. Likewise with The Prestige, another simply perfect film. On the flip side of that he gives us say, Dunkirk which for me was more than disappointing. Anyway, Tenet falls smack back in the middle. It's not a masterclass in filmmaking nor is it disappointing. It looks incredible and it's action packed and full of the trucks you'd expect from a Nolan film. However, it's just too convoluted and hard to follow. It's a bit too clever for its own good which sometimes can be a good thing but to most casual viewers it's just not worth the effort. I have watched it 3 times now and I admit it gets better with each viewing but you probably shouldn't need to watch something half a dozen times to fully grasp the story or what's going on. If you struggled with Inception then seriously give Tenet a miss it'll just leave you with a headache. If you want to watch it to be dazzled by jaw dropping set pieces then give it a go. It's not a bad film it just pushes filmmaking to new limits which isn't a bad thing.

On a footnote it would be interesting to see what Nolan could do if he was given the opportunity to helm a Bond movie because there's possibly no-one better at action sequences around right now."
Great idea - told mediocre,spam-778-616598,6/10,26 January 2023,"The idea is great, the plot points should work for most people - but it's told in a too confusing way. And I love complex stories! This just wasn't written very well. The special effects were great, of course, but the heroes goal was missing and the reason why we should care for him. It was all too confusing - I couldn't remember the characters or their stories, I didn't get most of the connections ... and that's coming from someone who loved a truly complex story like Dark. What looked extremely promising, turned out quite boring - my husband fell asleep at the end, because he couldn't follow anyway anymore. I say it's worth a watch - because the idea was great after all."
The thing on which the movie is built,Zeyders,7/10,25 January 2023,"Christopher Nolan's films always delight with their ideas, the quality of the films, and this film is no exception. But the film has its pluses and minuses in every moment.

The main thing on which the film is built is made qualitatively and difficult, but the explanation of this chip lasts almost the entire film. The whole main plot is built on this concept, which can't be called a minus, but also can't be a plus. The characters are not revealed, but the main characters are memorable. The special effects, the only thing, remain unqualified because Nolan prefers to recreate them live.

It's a good movie to watch. Interesting action, a concept that you see for the first time in movies exactly like this."
Complex or complicated?,tpvmpdbm,6/10,24 January 2023,"Tenet really wants to be a complex movie which feels like something you can not understand. And this kind of overwhelming story works. But to be honest it doesn't work to me.

It's not really complex...you just can't understand what is going on because the scenes are switching so fast, you are always busy to follow it.

At least the characters are not overwhelming. But in favor they are boring. You can not feel with them or see any progress they are going threw. They are just random characters who you will forget if you are rewatching tenet in the future.

But also it is really interesting to watch and challenging your mind. Can you follow the story the first time you are watching tenet? Maybe yes or maybe not. It doesn't matter because it is not a movie you should understand and this is what makes it complicated and not complex...even if tenet wants to be complicated. After the first time you haved watched tenet there is nothing you can think about and just your aha-moment of understanding what the heck was going on the last two hours."
It requires a lot of complex aches,dr_hgj-48231,10/10,22 January 2023,"C Nolan must be clapped as his team gave yet another complex scientific but confusing mixtures of all possible twist n turn exploring reversible time machine, reversing even physical, chemical, emotional,, all.... nal and....... cal limits crossed in confusing the film watcher. Has taken every possible filmy imaginary summersaults ways of impossibilities.... Giving current focus of Uranium, relationships, interest what next alive, fights, stunts, modern gazzets, reversible bullets weapons, every thing except human grid negativity kept growing!!!! Has mixed the current affairs, event reference, good acting, Music back ground sound effact, mono chrome color code to very high level. His reputation is built on still keeping Interest alive! Many youtubbers explaining the movie will flourish and will surely have newer verdict... I rate 10 so as not to do injustice to any section. It is mental excercise."
A feast of vision and thought,s-19392,8/10,22 January 2023,"I am a loyal fan of director Nolan. I have watched and enjoyed every film of his without exception. I think he is the director who really understands the art of film. For this film, I call it the feast of vision because I am really affected by every shot of it. Every shot, every picture, and every frame are individually captured as a work of art. In terms of the overall picture environment, this is the only work I feel comfortable with. In other words, I want you to watch it again. This is a very difficult thing for a science fiction film, And the director did it, which really made me very happy. The above is my feeling from the perspective of direct sense. Next, let's talk about the plot. As usual, I don't talk about the details. I admit that I may be a little stupid. When I saw the film for the first time, I didn't see the specific content of the story. The specific story is really a little complicated, but one thing is worth affirming. Although the story is complex and difficult, But there are no films with complex plots, which annoy the audience. After seeing them, they will never watch them for the second time. But this film is different. After watching it for the first time, you can't understand it. You will be eager to see it for the second time and the third time until you understand it. It is like a strong magnetic magnet, which has always attracted you to explore it. I especially admire the director's thinking ability. I have seen AI before, It was the first time I was attracted by him. After so long and watching so many films, I am very honest to tell you that he has not changed. This film also provided me with great inspiration in the creative process. The expression of ""transformation"" and the very artistic treatment also provided me with a lot of good help."
"More fantasy than sci-fi, but in a good way",noxaman,7/10,20 January 2023,"This is at its heart a time travel film, with a twist. As long as you don't try too hard to explain every little detail, the film is an enjoyable spy thriller with a completely original spin.

Upon a second viewing I was surprised to find myself not getting lost in the (now obvious) foreshadowing, but rather the sheer scale of the effort it must have taken to conceptualize and direct such a monster of a story. The movie is a soft-7, but the direction is a solid-10. That is to say, there's no way this story could have been told any better than it was. Telos in film.

Tenet is an obvious passion project, and while it's not my favorite film of the year, it is without a doubt the most innovative and best directed piece I have seen in a long time."
It's one of those films that you beg for it to finish,lucaspvirano,7/10,18 January 2023,"Despite being an entertaining film with a superb sci-fy time-related concept behind and impressive visuals, Tenet is practically unbearable to watch. It expects too much from the audience (and not only on following the convoluted plot). 2 and a 1/2 hours of such high-intensity action is brain-melting. At first said continous intensity makes the movie very appealing but as the plot develops, the mental energy from the audience diminishes. The result? Migraine + the desire of the end of the play.

To sum up, if you are into spionage and action films, you will enjoy it. But if you can't tolerate prolonged unclear action display, you will suffer watching it (as I did). In a nutshell: a peculiar hybrid of a popcorn action film with a high-IQ nolanesque attach."
Too slick and clever.,Pyst_Moo,4/10,16 January 2023,"If you want to spend this amount of time getting a bit of a headache, I'd suggest picking a different activity, it will feel less pretentious.

This films tries way to hard to be slick and clever, and should spend a little more time making the plot work - it's undoubtedly a good idea, but the execution, for me at least, was way to messy.

I've read that it takes a few viewings to really understand all the threads and how they interweave. But, truly, who has time for that when the first viewing wasn't anything I'd want to do again.

Added to that, I wished I'd looked up the cast... this film just adds to my theory that Branagh is the most overrated actor of his generation."
A Flashy Disappointment,BoraGungorTirmis,1/10,15 January 2023,"Christopher Nolan, known for his mind-bending, complex thrillers such as ""Inception"" and ""Memento."" However, in the case of ""Tenet"", it falls short of expectations. The film's plot, while marketed as complex and intricate, is actually quite straightforward and easy to predict. The main character, played by John David Washington, is also not well-developed or relatable.

The film's action scenes and visual effects are well-done, but the music and sound effects are overpowering and can be overwhelming. The film's focus on action and special effects leaves little room for character development, making it a shallow and unsatisfying experience.

Overall, ""Tenet"" is a disappointment. It fails to live up to the high expectations set by Nolan's previous work and falls short as a complex thriller. The film is loud and flashy, but it fails to engage the audience emotionally or intellectually. It's a bad action movie that fails to deliver on its promises."
An action movie that actually engages your brain,Louise1586,10/10,14 January 2023,"The acting is outstanding. Visual effects are top-notch. The score is perfect. Yes, you might have to watch this more than once. But that's my standard for any good movie: you want to see it again, don't you?

Don't watch this expecting a run-of-the-mill popcorn flick. Christopher Nolan makes movies for people who like to use their brains. And thank goodness for that. There are plenty of mindless movies out there with explosions and car chases that require very few neurons.

I have to laugh at the reviews that take aim at how the time travel/inversion doesn't make sense. Unless someone has successfully time traveled, and lived to tell the story, not sure they can really say what ""makes sense"" or not. The idea of time travel (or in this case ""inversion"") is open to creative interpretation. That's the joy of storytelling, isn't it?

In summary: It's not a bad movie just because you don't understand it.

I give it a solid 10/10."
Christopher Nolan is a mastermind,MatthewMichaelHoffman,10/10,14 January 2023,"SCORE: TBD

This is the first time I am not scoring a movie and it is because I still truly do not understand it, but I can I just tell that it's amazing. I've read a few articles on it and even watched a couple YouTube videos, but I still can't fully wrap my head around it. Like many other Nolan films such as Memento and Inception, you aren't going to pick up on everything upon first watch, which still makes him the best and most interesting director in my opinion. However, Tenet is the first of his movies that I just felt completely lost after the first watch. There is something to be said about the human mind and it's power to learn, ultimately becoming the subject matter expect in things we dedicate our time to. It's amazing how smart we can come off when describing something so simple to us, yet so complicated to the other 95% of people we interact with. Christopher Nolan is a mastermind and his ability to come up with stories like this is unparalleled. I know that one day I will fully understand what this movie is about, but until then I will continue to research and try to understand every aspect of it. Whether bad or good, there is no denying the uniqueness of this film and what it does to its audience members."
When you have to do more and more,danimar75,5/10,11 January 2023,"Difficult to handle a paradox. It gave me the impression that he wanted to go the extra mile. Apart from originality, the story seems to me to suffer. Nolan likes to complicate the plots and build a mosaic that realizes a picture only at the end. But in this case I've lost the enjoyment of experiencing the narrative journey in the context of a realization that did not convey credibility to me. So many minutes to say something that perhaps could have been told in a few. There are other topics in modern physics that I would like to see.

The intention to create something new in a film world of sequels is to be commended. But is it so hard to find good inspirations?"
Painful to watch,p-t-watson,3/10,10 January 2023,"I went to see this at the cinema and like most I was completely confused about what was happening.

The story is not that revealing and lots of unobvious sub plotting make it difficult to engage with. What's worse is the sound decisions; low vocal sound, high volume backing soundtrack. This seems to be deliberate but why would you mess with the sound in a movie. It's completely distracting

So I watched it at home and have since read about the main plot which is a pretty original idea. I then wanted to like the movie.

However, the most distracting issue that permeates the movie and prevents me from liking it is John Washington. He has a severe lack of presence, is dry dull and boring. He is a terrible actor, extremely incongruous with the scenes.

His acting is in the same league of the likes of East enders, not a high level movie like Tenet, directed by one the lead directors of the 21st century. What a fail in casting. The decision to cast Washington alongside a much more talented side such as Robert Pattinson is obsurd. Major fail in what could be an insightful movie.

Painful to watch and boring to see so much lead acting with such limited range!"
Hocus Pocus,aalreetmarra,5/10,6 January 2023,"The basic concept of the film is one that we've seen many times before. It's the usual villain in the fight between good and evil and is predictably Russian. This time instead of having a nuclear device to end the world he has an algorithm. An algorithm is an ordered or systematic set of instructions to resolve a problem. Also introduced here is entropy: high entropy disorder, low entropy order, so the concept of the film appears to be a contradiction as the villain is in favor of the high entropy, disorder. The villain goes about achieving his end goal by using an ordered, planned set of instructions contained in the algorithm in his possession. Yes, that is correct; in a nutshell, the concept is simply insane. He achieves his aim by using a time machine called in the script a ""turnstile,"" a very inventively futuristic device that you would come across in many mundane situations in real life. So we have Sator, the villain, married to Kat, played by Elizabeth Debicki, who is the best thing to watch in the film itself. She is in an unhappy marriage, which she wants to get out of, but as we go along in the script, Kat reveals that Sator has terminal pancreatic cancer. Is that not a big error in this story? Why didn't she just wait until he died? Then we have this unnamed CIA operative known as the protagonist, John David Washington. As is customary, a love interest with Kat is introduced, or perhaps this highly trained spy and killer's weak spot is that he just comes undone by any beautiful woman. Yes, apparently this happens a lot in the CIA, L. O. L. In reality, we live on the only known planet in the known universe, which has everything that is needed to sustain all life in our own ordered solar system. The disorder we are seeing now is caused by the antagonists who want to maintain their own order of me first and, in that process, let's get as rich as we can and to hell with the consequences. They are opposed by protagonists who wish to the current state of affairs, which will eventually lead to the destruction of our eco-system and the extinction of all life. Entropy is a scientific concept, just as evolution is an unproven theory, and scientists, clever as they are, will never find or really understand the answer to everything. The universe is constantly recreating itself by expanding, so their constant learning to understand that process will be a game of constant catch-up with no end. The current view appears to be, ""Let's look for another planet because we've trashed this one."" This film's script is basically destroy the past and live in the future so we have in reality nearly achieved the first part. But will there be a future? Only Science Fiction can do that."
Something different from Nolan's hand,HafizhMaulana21,9/10,6 January 2023,"A Protagonist undergoes a complicated mission by saving the world from future time attacks that can change the survival of the entire world.

It wouldn't be Christopher Nolan if it didn't make the audience confused and think hard about watching the film. Tenet is such a complicated science fiction movie. Too mathematical. Nolan was inspired by the story of quantum physics. This is what makes it difficult for ordinary people to understand. Many of my own word terms are also not used to being heard. Some of the scientific concepts that run in this movie I also never heard of. As a result, many people have difficulty in understanding this movie and it is difficult to digest every scene. The film seems to have been made for scientists.

Tenet has a complex and interconnected storyline. Using a story related to the existence of a time war that takes place in the future is unique to this film. The back-and-forth plot will always be Nolan's trademark, including this film which also makes us have to repeat some of the scenes in this movie. Tenet has such a fast pace of the film that it makes the film even harder to understand. Given the use of the term science in his dialogue. Some scenes also seem to be to the point in providing explanations. There are also some scenes that are seen in the cut, giving rise to plot holes in the story.

This film is interesting, it's just that it sees some cases where the story is still hollow, scenes that don't look perfect are weaknesses in this film. Likewise, the messy audio effect is an oddity in itself in my opinion in Nolan's own track record. Between the voices of the actors and the background music overlap each other. Especially when the scene of wearing a mask is really not clearly heard what they say. For his acting, both John David Washington and Robert Pattinson are excellent. Overall, the film is very good and a masterpiece. If you really understand."
A mess,alexandramkeene,6/10,6 January 2023,"I'm sure this was a good movie, but i wasn't taking notes (because i was watching a movie) so i couldn't keep up. Good performances across the board and Nolan movies are always stylistically impressive but the plot was so complicated and scattered. If you're going to see this, get some spoilers so you can wrap your head around it and you won't spend the whole movie trying to chart out what's going on. It's like Inception on steroids mixed with a sci fi James Bond. Good concept, but it's too all over the place for a one-time viewer. When it was over all I could say was ""what just happened?????"""
What's the opposite of Suspense and Action?,bbwwmcmc,4/10,26 December 2022,"Oh yeah, boredom and tediousness. So in that sense, mission accomplished.

Perhaps for future films the crypto Nolan can focus a bit less on the overtly stagey prescience and share more than the visual creep of Bane's mask that so weirdly and coincidentally resonates in today's social dystopia (what is it with breathing masks in his movies like ALL of the Tom Hardy characters?).

Give us a real peek of the secret societies instead for a change, if you dare Christopher.

Sure, he's no Kubrick and it shows, no reverse gear needed there. 'Too Clever by Half' in Nolan's case becomes 'Too Clever by a Millionth' with all its accompany devaluation.

Palindromically, a more suitable title for the movie would have been, 'Dud'.

Save yourself at least 2 and a half hours in this dimension, perhaps more if you then skip the parallel ones you may reside in, and take a hard pass.

Time will then be on your side."
A challenging masterpiece.,fb6ins1z1,9/10,25 December 2022,"They say imagination - not knowledge - is the true sign of intelligence. Well, Christopher Nolan must be quite the genius. The premise on which the plot of this movie is based is something many people don't even know about in its theoretic form. Yet Nolan dared to write it into a story, imagined and visualized, and present it in a fairly digestible manner despite the inherent risk of goofs and continuity errors in such a production. All of that requires imagination far beyond the average person possesses.

Tenet is certainly not meant to be enjoyed by everybody. First of all, in order to make the most of this experience, the viewer needs to have at least the simplest understanding of entropy and the non-linearity of space and time. While Tenet presents to us in the opening minutes the phenomena and how they apply to the plot, it may all seem like complete fiction if the viewer has no prior knowledge of the fact that ""reverse entropy"" is actually possible due to nothing in the math that explains our physical universe suggesting otherwise.

Tenet has a familiar feel, akin to Memento and Inception, both of which are also directed and written by Nolan. However, in terms of concessions made for allowing the plot to be more accessible to the average viewer, Tenet may well represent the epitome of Nolan's approach that I suspect aims to isolate the intelligent from the average. The viewer is never spoon-fed throughout this experience. The dialogue is concise and wastes no time in delivering critical information. There are practically no greetings; every conversation sprints straight to the point, and missing as little as 15 seconds of it can mean the subsequent chapter will make much less sense. What Nolan asks of the viewer for the best experience is not only some prior knowledge on the physics but also undivided attention.

Tenet is certainly challenging to watch, especially if you feel lost along the way. Could it have been made more accessible? Yes, I think so, but I don't know at what cost. The aforementioned concise dialogue and the cold, quiet professionalism of the main characters are essential ingredients in setting the tone here. Also, by the induced difficulty to follow the plot at times, the viewer is ushered into realizing how advanced our minds would have to be in order to understand the theory behind such complex physics, let alone develop technology to harness its potential. It deliberately intimidates us.

This movie is difficult to rate because it is unique - despite having similarities with Nolan's other products. I think the only detractor can be its lack of accessibility, but I also believe that is one of its key features. In terms of imagination and creativity, films like this are hard to come by. I understand why many reviewers underrated Tenet, but it is actually a masterpiece that was just waiting for the right mind(s) to come along and film it."
Fennel,simmans,4/10,23 December 2022,"I watched Tenet...

And then, finally, I watched Tenet with subtitles, because it's on Netflix, thinking I would enjoy it more...

I did not.

Sure, I had better access to the exposition, which is fine, but the grander plot was no more sensible than when I first watched, Sam's subtitles.

In brief, Tenet is far less clever than it imagines itself.

Time travel is complicated, certainly, proven by the fact that we haven't yet accomplished it. The best time travel movies establish their loose rules, then dance to Chuck Berry tunes, because time travel logic can never adhere to itself. Back To The Future and Avengers: Endgame succeed despite their failures. That is, ""Let's get on with the rest of the plot, because this time travel thing is never going to stand up to scrutiny.""

Tenet is a film that has no other plot to move on to, because it is entirely concerned with making its non-logic logical.

I imagine that writer-director Christopher Nolan lost precious sleep because he convinced himself that he could concoct a perfect time travel MacGuffin... but in doing so he sacrificed any kind of narrative that the audience could invest itself in.

Marty McFly saves his family. Tony Stark gets the Infinity Stones and palavers with his dad. Sarah Connor goes to the playground... these popcorn moments don't exist in Tenet.

Nolan has inserted his head so far up his own bottom, trying to concoct a logical time travel narrative, that he forgot to include a fun adventure.

His greatest failing, however, is that his time travel dynamics don't stand up to scrutiny... and the dull mess he's left behind make even less sense than when Marty McFly woke up to a family of happy, succesful siblings.

I mean... did some contractor actually build Freeport facilities using pre-shot glass?"
Unrealized masterpiece,sajjadgarshasbi-1995,10/10,20 December 2022,"Tenet is an exciting movie with great content.

This is not an opinion based on feelings, but I came to this conclusion after carefully reviewing the film.

About the visual effects of the film, I have to say that you are greeted with a beautiful painting in all the sequences.

Nolan has captured amazing images by choosing the best locations around the world.

The music of the film serves the narration of the story and keeps the heart rate of the audience high.

In the sequences where time is reversed, everything is executed perfectly and there are no technical flaws.

He warns us about the third world war. The atmosphere of the film is designed in such a way that the audience feels a strange and real fear of a possible war. And this is a masterpiece in every sense.

The complexity of the story is sweet and pleasant and does not go beyond the limit to be a source of torment for the audience.

Don't get involved in finding scientific answers to the presented topics and just feel them.

Then you will understand that Nolan warned us in simple language that if we use the resources of the world in the same way, it is possible that the next generations will find the intention to go back to the past and destroy us after the invention of the time machine.

This is a general analysis of Nolan's film.

The chase sequences are also made as beautifully as possible.

Philosophically, Nolan has spoken a lot in the form of symbols and playing with words and sentences through the dialogues exchanged between the actors."
Nolan shows us again he is a skillful visionary,mabmadridespana,10/10,17 December 2022,"This film arrives at the rare achievement of being able to make present and future match in a perfectly logical palindrome. There is an ambitious premise behind each detail of the script: to balance two opposite views of time, onwards and backwards, our actual time and space and a utopian one, and take us to the middle of this balance.

Its score, under the supervision of an emerging genius such as Ludwig Goransson, makes a perfect match for the intensity demanded by the complex montage. Visuals are strikingly original, and it all sums up to set a notion of timelessness in such a critical context us this days we are living in..."
"Clever, clever but not smart.",lastminutemike,3/10,16 December 2022,"To make a name for learning when other ways are barred, take something very simple and make it very hard. Piet Hein wrote that.

Nolan is trying too hard. When you unweave the story from its telling it's not very interesting, and that is disguised but not improved by the way it is told. I'm sure it all looked good on paper and the backwards forwards stuff made sense in diagrammatic form but as a film it just went sideways into the territory of ""who cares"". The emotional content was sketched in rather than developed

There have been several films, including Following and Memento, where a simple story has been made more enthralling by telling it in a complex fashion. This was not one of them."
Who green-lighted this movie?,mrkcase,3/10,13 December 2022,"When you walk out of a movie and have no idea what's it's about..then it's a bad movie. Forget about the dialog. You won't be able to hear it and none of it matters anyway. Who are all the characters? You'll never know and I doubt you'll even remember their names while taking the post movie bathroom visit. Hopefully Nolan can chill out with his obsession with time. It's worked in other movies but I started getting nervous with the jumbled up timelines in Dunkirk. To me, this movie is unwatchable. Go watch ""Primer"" instead. A great indie time travel movie.

I need to put extra characters to post this."
Tries too hard to be complex,ullasharma-95619,7/10,12 December 2022,"I really like Nolan's movies. All of them have been astoundingly good.

I like the way he plays with timelines and also I like to come with my own analysis.

But with Tenet , it seems like Nolan has deliberately tried to over-complicate a simple (compared to his other) story line.

Ofcourse , by intentionally leaving several scenes open-ended + playing around the editing , he has managed to confuse his audience.

Perhaps this indeed was his goal and not really to make his ideas clear.

Nolan fans will tend to try 'understanding' this story and interpret in their own ways , in an attempt to prove their own intelligence.

But story isnt as complicated , as i understand.

Here is what I Understood : All major powers have already discovered the ways of time travel , which they call 'turnstiles'.

The inverse technology is already well known and used by Super-Secret government organizations.

This screws up the future generations , and they try to find a way to find objects and humans who have been 'inversed'.

A scientist discovers a program named 'Tenet' , which basically when activated searches and destroys all 'inversed objects'.

Government agencies in future and past , realizing the danger of this program - hunt the scientist and and she breaks the program down into 9 pieces and hides them.

The government agencies then hire protagonist in the past to track and find the program.

Meanwhile , rebels in future - who want the problematic future to end for good , recruit Antagonist (Andrei) to collect all pieces of program and execute it.

But protagonist , knowing Governments true intentions , has his own plans.

The protagonist manages to find the program before it gets executed , takes it apart into three pieces.

Result : The timeline is undisturbed , Governments continue to use timemachines and future is doomed.

Other characters are introduced intentionally by Nolan to muddle things."
Very Good,rabeaaron,8/10,2 December 2022,"Nolan never ceases to amaze as he finds a new way of creating a movie around time. Unfortunately, this film stands out more as an impressive technical achievement than a gripping story you truly care about. Tenet's world gets lost in the weeds and lacks the character development to place this film in the top-tier category like many of Nolan's previous films. This film is worth a watch but will not be remembered as Nolan's best work.

Thinking hard or hardly thinking?,phlame64,6/10,2 December 2022,"It's innovative, but that's all there is to it. Nolan wanted to surprise the audience and appeal to intelligent people, but the plot ends up being all familiar from hundreds of other action/thriller films. The special effects were fantastic and a total waste of money, as usual with Hollywood movies. The backward scenes could have probably been done better. It's one of those films that you're supposed to watch twice or three times to fully comprehend. If only the prospect of seeing it again was more appealing, that is. I'm sure there's a lot of scientific nonsense, speculation, and errors, too. As is typical of Nolan films, he takes unconfirmed scientific theories (mostly from physics) for granted, adds a few paradoxes, guns, explosions, and attractive women, and makes billions. Dialogues were rather shallow, with a few highly technical terms thrown in here and there to make them sound deep. I watched it only to understand what people were talking about, but won't watch it again and won't recommend watching it."
"A chaotic mess, I love it!",sionetupou-25970,9/10,29 November 2022,"I love the concept, I love the visuals and I love the way it all ties up in the end. Granted this movie will be difficult to enjoy if you try too hard to understand it, just take notice of what happens and see it through. A second watch through wouldn't hurt either. Moving, fighting and shooting in reverse is crazy, even to come up with the idea as Christopher Nolan pulls off.

Granted as I mentioned thinking too hard wod negate ones enjoyment. Not to mention the main character feels flat for me. Witty and competent, just flat in terms of natural charisma.

Overall a good watch if you got the time to pay attention."
"Like the movie or not, Tenet is a groundbreaking cinematic achievment",manshowerdan,8/10,23 November 2022,"The time reversal scenes, the fight scene, and the way Nolan was able to capture scenes that were almost completely reversed accept the character. These alone are truly amazing accomplishments but I also think the rest of the movie is better than some people give it credit for. It is a bit confusing but personally I like to think out movies and this is probably the most timey wimey movie i've ever watched. I really do think that some people don't understand it and are thinking of things too linear which are some of the super negative reviews.

The movie is clearly very well thought out and accomplishes establishing a lot of revolutionary film making techniques and ideas."
"You were just watching it for the cool visuals, be honest you had no clue what was going on",charlesdavidson-54251,2/10,21 November 2022,"I remember watching this for the first time after hearing great things, but I was I left completely confused and not wanting answers.

The main character is so boring, he didn't have a single defining trait. A plot is cool on paper but the storytelling is just so dumb. The whole time travel thing is not explained well in the slightest, now I'm not expecting a top of the class science graduate level explanation but just something would be nice. The pacing is broken, all throughout the film I was constantly asking, why are we were, why are we doing this.

By the time we get to the final act there are so many characters and people that we don't know. I'll give it this though, the whole effect of running through a city while it's being destroyed in reverse (yes, that is real) looks really dope, in fact most of the film looks really good. But when you're constantly asking why to everything, it really takes away from what would have been a really cool scene.

The villain wasn't anything special and I'm constantly internally screaming ""HE'S RIGHT THERE"" and the excuse they give is so stupid 'we need him alive for information', like what information. It's so stupid especially since he's killed later in the film anyway so wtf. And the final twist was dumb and didn't need to be in the film

Overall, I'm sure this film has it's fans but I'm not one of them. The plot and story is so confusing that it effectively ruins what what have been cool scenes. The characters are dull and didn't leave an impression on me. I have heard this is a film I need to watch multiple times but this isn't one I plan on revisiting."
#Masterful_movie,Mehul-Parkhiya,10/10,19 November 2022,"TENET

Watching this movie was the best movie experience I have ever had and you should definitely go and experience it too.

It had great acting, story, cinematography, music and dialogue. The concept of inversion was worked out perfectly, just like you're used to from Nolan. Sure, it was complicated but if you pay attention it is really never incomprehensible. Because of the concept of inversion you'll set your eyes on things you have never seen before in any movie or series.

That is also one of the many aspects that make Tenet a very special movie and a real experience, and an experience you will definitely want to experience again. In my opinion, if you loved other Nolan movies like Inception, Interstellar, Memento and The Prestige you will undoubtedly absolutely love Tenet too.

Christopher Nolan? The man who keeps delivering.. I feel so stupid after seeing his movies the first time, but yet I'm still so impressed. He makes a movie, which I love, but not quite understand completely. I can't stop thinking about it and after some hours, I slowly start to make sense.

Tenet was terrific, even tho my brain felt blended."
Ignore all the 1 star troll review,jedkonmars,7/10,12 November 2022,"A miracle happened yesterday I went to the cinema again and watching this film makes me so great to be back in.

Tenet (2020) is a recently released spy thriller directed Christopher Nolan who's known for directing films like Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014) and The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005-2012), this film was supposed to come out in July but then a certain something happened so it got pushed back to August.

The plot revolves around 2 spies on a mission to prevent World War 3 which instead of nuclear weapons will be caused by a bullet that will reverse time.

As the first film I've seen at the cinema after a long time, It was a really good film, the acting was really good, the action scenes were well choreographed, I love the way they shot the film and as a replacement for Han Zimmer Ludwig Goransson brings us a fantastic score.

However the movie can be confusing at some scenes especially the bits when they go back in time.

But all in all this movie was a really good spy thriller and is definitely worth a ticket to see."
Ummmmmm WHAT DID I JUST WATCH ??,ezyja,5/10,11 November 2022,"Seriously I like Nolan and am a fan of the cast, but WTF is this movie ?

It starts at the end, or beginning or whatever he's trying to pitch here, the score is so pulsating and so loud the audio is muffled out and then he adds the fact we can travel in reverse while travelling forwards in the same situation using a pincer object.......not making sense.....HA wait til u see this and just try making sense of it.

Nolan is too smart for his own britches in this epic and hopefully he returns to simplistic viewing of memento......that's right I said it, Memento was simplistic compared to this attempt at a pleasurable experience.

It's hard to watch and hard to understand and takes effort viewing (which ull have to do multiple times to make any sense) even just the once."
Please rewind the tape,vhtfykyys,4/10,9 November 2022,"Back in the 70s when we were kids in school the teacher would occasionally show us educational films on a reel to reel projector. Even more occasionally she would accidentally queue the spool the wrong way, or at then end of the movie we'd plea with her to keep the projector on while she respooled the film back to the original reel. We found it hilarious to see water flow back into cups, people walk backwards, balls bounce into hands... Later in the 80s we'd sometimes do the same with rented films, preparing them for return, though it was no longer so uncanny and amazing. In the 90s music video directors would get singers to learn their words backwards so they could reverse the film for effect. It was cool at first but became a fairly obvious trope. With digital film and personal computers making reverse play easy there is no novelty in doing so.

Tenet seems to exist purely because you can rewind recorded film. Maybe if it came out in 1978 minds would have blown. Today the conceit is so obvious it is impossible to enjoy naively, constantly calling attention to the fact that we are watching a movie. The final battle scenes hilariously expose the poor ability of extras to walk backwards as if they are walking forwards. I found it impossible to ever suspend disbelief.

Perhaps it wouldn't matter if the script was any good, or the acting brilliant. But dialogue is terrible, wooden, first draft poor. The story makes no sense. It is all entirely bad. Nolan I want my time back. Rewind pls."
"You need to understand it, to appreciate it.",muskad202-804-796887,8/10,5 November 2022,"A very different take on time-travel.

You need to understand it, to appreciate it.

To understand it, I had to watch it twice.

I wouldn't mind watching it once more.

As expected, most audiences found it difficult to understand, and thus appreciate. And most wont have the patience (and rightly so, this shouldn't be a requirement) to watch it more than once.

Nevertheless, its great that we have someone like Christopher Nolan who can churn out mentally stimulating movies like Inception and Tenet.

Subtitles would have been great, and were very much needed in the scenes where the characters are talking through their gas masks."
Two genres squished into one that make it very challenging to understand,jordyntsmith,7/10,2 November 2022,"A spy thriller where the main character is trying to stop the unraveling of all humanity against an enemy who can move through time.

The concept of the movie is interesting. I would have liked a deeper exploration of moving backward through time. Unfortunately, the movie becomes very difficult to follow due to the whole spy plot. If the movie had explored the whole time element through a different genre, one where the motives and intentions of the characters are not intentionally hidden, then I think his could have been great.

It's a very dense movie that is hard the follow. The visuals are quite good though, and the actors are all excellent. It's not for everyone, but those who enjoy Nolan's work would probably enjoy it."
Most Mind Blowing Movie of All Time,hnambiar,10/10,1 November 2022,"Tenet is one of those movies where with every rewatch of the movie, you appreciate it even more.

As a Cristopher Nolan fan, I thoroughly enjoyed every single bit of the movie, everything from the idea, acting, storylines, set pieces and implementation. Every single thing is done to perfection.

WARNING: If you do not like to rewatch movies and have to think deeply about the movie, then this movie is not for you.

Tenet is a cinematic masterpiece with its unique idea, set pieces and motifs.

I know many people did not understand it even after rewatching it. I understood it the first time I saw it, rewatched it the next day and appreciated it even more.

Nolan: Yes Me: How much should I blow your mind?"
Tenet is a masterpiece,lukekspivey,10/10,31 October 2022,"There are a few legitimate complaints about this movie, but people who don't like it seem to focus their reviews on things that aren't even true. Tenet can be difficult to follow if you have to be spoon-fed dialogue, if most other time travel movies hurt your head, or if you don't understand the concept of entropy even after googling it. If you meet those requirements Tenet should score at least an 8/10 for you with its easy-to-appreciate aspects. These come in the form of great acting, the score, well-choreographed fights despite its sci-fi focus, and witty humor that doesn't slow down the incredible pace. I'm happy that people can watch this movie and enjoy it, but what is disappointing to me is the inability of people to put effort into the films they are watching. Tenet, like other Nolan films, will reward you immensely for putting forth some time and thought. I have seen many reviews listing issues with the movie that simply do not exist. To avoid spoilers, I will not debunk them here but know that you should watch the movie (probably more than once), and only once you fully understand it do you allow yourself to be influenced by the rest of the people here who don't know what's going on. Assuming you watch this in the right mindset and give it a genuine chance, I don't see how this could not become some of anyone's favorite movies.

The part above is for people who are deciding whether or not to watch the film. I may later write my thoughts on the movie, but it might be my #1 of all time."
"Headache-inducing, not always in a good way",massimilianofoschi,7/10,30 October 2022,"Christopher Nolan is often rightfully appreciated for creating complex movies with skillful exposition such that the audience understands enough to be thrilled, but is still left with the desire to rewatch the flick to comprehend all the intricacies. With Inception and Interstellar, he succeeded admirably. In Tenet, on the other hand, he left a lot to be desired.

Tenet's main sin is that the root of the confusion it induces in the viewer is in how the underlying symmetrical harmony of the story is covered by what is essentially smoke. The issue is not a lack of logic, an emotional core or whatever, it's that it struggles to convey the central themes effectively. Nevertheless, if you're willing to the work yourself, there is some reward at the end, so it's generally worth seeing."
What's with all the bad reviews?,zachswaze,9/10,28 October 2022,"This film has honestly become one of my favorite releases over the last couple years. I've watched it at least 4/5 times. Much more that Inception which everyone seems to think was better, but I have to disagree. Are people mad that they actually have to pay attention and think about complex theories? Maybe just stick to the unoriginal time travel movies like The Adam Project or Back to The Futures lol.

The concept was very original. Decent twists that play out with the discovery of Neil being recruited by The Protagonist in the future, how he is the one to save him in the beginning of the movie. The tone, cinematography, effects, acting were all great. I would love to see a sequel that explores who invents the inversion technology and the war that insures in the future."
Terrible audio/soundtrack,patrick-413,3/10,26 October 2022,"Sorry, but I hated this movie. It had so much potential: I love the cast, I like the concept, and some of the action scenes are quite good. But aside from the overly complicated plot, which was distracting but not a deal-breaker, I just hated the soundtrack.

First, let's just get this out of the way: the music is terrible. It's like the worst of the Tangerine Dream scores from the 70s and 80s on steroids. That style of score ruined so many otherwise good movies from that era that I believe it constitutes a blight on cinema, but this is even worse. Completely obtrusive, overpowering, and unlistenable.

And then, to make matters worse, the ""music"" was mixed so high that it constantly overpowered the dialogue. There were several places where I had no idea what people were saying because the score was MUCH louder than the voices.

I'll say that the plot, while convoluted and based on ideas that were logically flawed, would probably be better up on a second viewing. But the first viewing was so unpleasant and painful that I'll never give it that second watch that the filmmakers were obviously hoping I'd give it.

Three stars only for the good characters and interesting dialogue - what little of it I could hear, that is."
Confusing boring with obnoxiously loud background noises,lopezpatricia-06139,1/10,22 October 2022,This film is an insult to anyone with a basic grasp of physics. Even a physics lecture would be easier to follow than this crap. I had to nurse the Bluetooth speaker in my hand because the dialogue was impossible to hear but any other noises like a gun going off or a car door slamming were absolutely deafening and a complete assault of our senses. As everyone has said it's beyond difficult to follow making it boring boring boring!! I've been a die hard fan of sci fi my whole life but this made no sense at all. If it had been 2 hours or less I'd have seen it through but the last 25 mins we just cut our losses and shut it down like a roach infested cafe. Oh and check out when one guy described the grandfather paradox saying there is no right answer. What utter nonsense.
"God, this movie is really dumb and badly made",flingebunt,3/10,21 October 2022,"It starts with the possibility of an interesting twist on time travel. But the plot only moves forward through people sit around talking. Meanwhile there is all this action padding out the run time. The action is basically a really dumb spy thriller.

Then it ends up as a conventional time travel story. What is worse, the effects are boring, the logic doesn't make much sense, the plot is poorly executed.

This is Peak Christopher Nolan, in that he loves to play around with time and times lines in his movies, but proves he is not up to the task. It only appears to be a smart movie to dumb people. Give this one a miss."
Fascinating. Magical. Engaging screenplay,tejassawant13,9/10,20 October 2022,"A bit of confusing yet engaging story. Nolan Sir's direction and Screenplay is super tight. I loved all characters. Protagonist and Neil, both characters were well written.

Story of the movie is a bit confusing, and its good attempt because story is meant to confuse the audience. All the 3 acts in the movie are like climax in a way. And the reason behind it is the Direction of the movie.

The film demands attention and careful observation at camera work, dialogues, etc.

Cinematography is good. Especially camera work.

Special appreciation for Background score. Background score is the heart of the movie. So engaging. Hats off. It has power to give you at edge of the seat on lots of scenes.

Film has some negative points, such as it is not a popcorn enjoy movie. It demands your attention. Yeah!

Must Watch for sure."
The most intelligent sci-fi in decades,michaelkostukov,9/10,18 October 2022,"You will likely not enjoy the movie if you do not enjoy mind-bending puzzles. The movie is almost impossible to understand on the first watching. In the world of simplistic Marvel style superhero movies where the average movie goers' attention span is less than a minute- this movie will confuse a lot of people from the get go. They will inevitably project their frustration into negative ratings and complains of ""poor writing"". It requires at least two or three watchings to fully appreciate how good the writing actually is, the amazing attention to details and how everything actually makes sense - contrary to the initial perception."
Enjoyable if you don't think about it,tesmond,6/10,17 October 2022,"The film was fun and interesting, but not if you start thinking about it.

One of the great aspects of Nolan films is afterwards you want to go away and discuss them and think about the concepts and the story points that occur. This film is no exception.

Much like his other films it has an interesting concept that makes you want to delve into more and really think about it. This is sadly the point that everything falls apart. As soon as you start thinking about character motivations, the flow off the story and alternative choices you start to realise that the whole thing kind of falls apart.

I cannot actively recommend it but some of the concepts are interesting enough that it is more than just watchable. However, it does feel a little like the set pieces were written before the entire plot and the plot was really there to force the set pieces into play."
Garbage,salmar-26419,1/10,17 October 2022,"This movie is total garbage. The acting is stiff and cardboard, like everyone is reading off a piece of paper. The score is a total assault on the senses as is the whole movie. I feel that the positive reviews are from pretentious people who found the movie so bad that they think they must have missed something, so they give it a positive review to not appear ignorant. I don't mean to insult anyone, but I just don't understand how anyone found anything to like about this movie. This wants to be an intelligent movie, but it just isn't. I don't leave a lot of reviews, but this movie is just so bad that I had to write this to justify the time wasted watching it."
Over complex! but had potential!,curtistyrell,5/10,16 October 2022,"If only they simplified how time and objects were shifted. They could have atleast done a more simiplified presentation of the technoglogy or the scientific reasons behind it. It would have been so much more easier to follow if they'd done this. Cause I mean the film wasnt terrible, It just felt like the writer tried way too hard to make things sound complex and interesting when in the end it didnt really make sense at all.

I've watched this movie twice now and still struggled on the second viewing. Though the second time was much easier than the first since I already had a rough idea what was happening. I also had to watch it with subtitles since the audio muffled and dialogue is very hard to catch in parts. Some parts the dialogue just sounds like the actors are straight mumbling.

Considering the movie was written and directed by Christipher Nolan, you could say it was a bad movie. That's comparing to his other works. It definitely had potential, and I could have seen this as a good sequel, but only if the story or dialogue was more simplied or they presented what was happening more thoroughly, the dialogue was clear and didnt need sub titles, and the characters were believeable.

Overall. Not a bad movie, not a good movie. Had potential."
Boring Bond rip off,mcoats-71101,3/10,14 October 2022,"Not sure how this film got such a high rating, people will think anything is good these days!

It starts off well, but soon descends into what all these Bond-like films tend to, quickfire scenes that don't necessarily tie together, a few explosions, overly sped up repartee between multiple characters who always know a little too much about every subject in the world, and of course an English thesp playing an over the top Russian baddy. Yawn. Sure there are some great locations shot in but then you'd expect that in a Bond-esque rip off. Oh and chuck in Michael Caine for a cameo because you know he's British.

I don't buy Washington in the main role, nepotism aside, he's too small and awkward to be ""the protagonist"". He's too stiff, delivers his obvious one liners terribly ""at least buy me dinner first"" when being frisked and he and Pattison look like they'd struggle to run a 5k challenge let alone take on and beat up multiple burly Russians.

The plot too is just trying to be complex for the same of it, like a mix between Inception and Bourne - this fails on multiple levels. It's lazy, overacted, trite and quite frankly incredibly dull."
Great..... but Mumble mumble,ijiqkwfv,6/10,14 October 2022,"This film would have been a 9 for me. It's extremely complex but I enjoy understanding more of the plot on each rewatch. It is clearly intended to be both immersive and thought provoking and certainly succeeds on many levels. I also thought some of the performances were excellent, particularly the ""baddie"" who I would not want to meet.

But sad to say the sound has ruined it for me. With a plot this complex the viewer feels compelled to grasp every word being spoken and with Tenet this proved impossible. Some scenes I watched 5 times in quick succession but were just an incomprehensible mumble to me, particularly from the main character. Having to turn on the subtitles to get key plot points is a real turn off.

What a shame."
Low IQ People Are Hilarious...This Film Needs A Re-Release,bowen101-160-829536,10/10,11 October 2022,"Gotta love the hilarity of people with the IQs of potatoes crying and whining about ""pretentious"" and ""boring"". They just want a ""good guy get hot girl and shoot bad guy in face and save day"" for their plots. If it were left up to these cave-crawling, likely gun-toting no-IQ hick degenerates, cinema would have no depth, and everything would be explained to them using no more than 5 letter words written in crayon. Go watch all the Fast movies (no offense) or Marvel if you want low-effort entertainment for the rest of your life. Some of us like to use our brains. What a joke. Imagine admitting to having the intellectual range of a fruit fly and then blaming other people for you being confused. Get gud you insufferable numbnuts.

Most of the negative reviews complain about the film simply having depth and a plot line that isn't laid out for you in the first 5 minutes. This movie breaks the mold of no effort storytelling and weaves together a plot with tons of moving parts that fit together seamlessly. I will say the sound mixing was indeed odd at points where there was dialogue, and several scenes were tough to understand what people were saying. Be sure to watch with subtitles to get everything, but it's not necessary to enjoy the film. It's a wild and very satisfying ride."
A mess,amanfra-95901,6/10,10 October 2022,I love Nolan films. Even when they don't make much sense such as Interstellar. What frustrates me about this film is that the dialog is truly well-written but we can't even hear it over the annoying endless violins that sound like the giant speaker in Back to the Future. Like goodness. I'm trying to understand a complicated fictional story so that I can understand why half the film is played in reverse lol. I've watched it three times and still can't hear it three times. The other problem is terrible scene transitions. Like walking to motor boating (giggity) to sail boating to balcony jumping to dinner to sitting on a couch to whispering to yelling to forwarding to backwarding. LOL I've never needed to take a nap after a movie so much than after the incredibly exhausting Tenet.
A movie that had to be seen twice to be exelent,maxpinzonestrada,10/10,8 October 2022,"The first time you watch it you keep with the freaking that it was too long and that it was too complicated, BUT the second time you watch it you understand it and you understand why EACH SINGLE FRAME , not more or less, was important and needed for this movie to be exelent. Defenetly one of my favorite movies of all time when you start to think about it, because it's not a movie that just tells you what is happening, you see what is happening and understand it right in that moment you see it and that's what is perfect. Also things that happen, and you don't understand it, but it gets explained at the very end because it's a time traveling movie and it just makes sense to explain things when they are happening in the right timeline and not in the reversed because that would take the tension effect away. The movie and the Musik are perfectly made and interact perfect with each other. A A literal masterpiece.

10/10."
mumbo jumbo,williams-14,3/10,7 October 2022,"Honestly, this is nonsense designed to make stupid people feel clever

and frankly, given the 7.3 rating ... it worked.

I didn't enjoy it. It didn't make sense. It's noise, soundbites, explosions. There's really not much more to it. Lots of music, chases, a tall woman playing exactly the same role she played in The Night Manager.

This is an empty vacuous piece of flash trash for a generations whose attention span is too short to tell a coherent story from a training montage. It's what the 20s deserve.

I'm just astonished / saddened that this is considered top class film making. It's glitter and smoke bombs."
Chis Nolan bomb,paah1944,1/10,3 October 2022,"Have been a Chris Nolan fan big time since watching/ following the Batman trilogy What an effort. Best Batman actor. Best bad guy actor an Aussie In receipt of an Oscar posthumous. Best support actors Gary Oldman a gem. That's two poms Bale & Oldman plus Nolan the pom. Batman not overly complicated or drawn out with monster action pieces. Good story and viewer friendly memorable. This being the main reason I decided to watch Tenet a pommie effort which usually/mostly succeeds. Wrong from the outset sports arena terrorist attack it was foggy complicated all over the shop made no sense blurred vacant rudderless whottha?. A female enters and mumbles alot. The Sci fi where are we really stuff gave me a headache. The lead actor looked like he regretted signing on and bored. Forty five minutes into it I bailed. Maybe Nolan has followed the Cohen brothers to a hole in the ground?

Patrick."
Hands down. Boundaries of cinema is pushed.,anil_pattanaik,9/10,2 October 2022,"Excellent movie, it is definitely difficult to understand in first watch, but that's the style. We go to movie theatre to watch something which will blow our mind, so TENET is the best example. You will be astonished how Christopher Nolan is raising his bars for himself in movie making from ""Following"" to ""Tenet"".

The whole movie is difficult as it was difficult to digest ""Time Travelling"" in early 80's. You will love the movie if you can think everything in non-linear ways ;)

Look, don't get in the theatre if you can't stop thinking in linear terms :) - reference from the movie as told by Aaron Taylor-Johnson."
Overwrites Itself,oliviaburgin17,1/10,2 October 2022,"This film tangles itself up in its own narrative. We have allowed Nolan too much power, and he's collapsed in on himself in a black hole of nonsense.

The logic doesn't hold up, the characters are emotionless and the sound design is atrocious. This film has Nolan's trademark coldness, to its absolute detriment. It lacks any emotional depth and any narrative coherence, losing itself in its own justification and washing up on its own mediocrity with nothing to protect itself with.

Also, write women better. He needs to write better women. This film was so boring because it was just men fighting men about nothing, and it's the same men as in all his other films. Something new please Nolan!"
Very confusing !!,bfsr81,2/10,26 September 2022,"I enjoyed most of Nolan's movies. Those dealing with different time lines such as Inception, memento or Interstellar where one of the best Science Fiction movies in 2000s as they were very enjoyable and understandable.

Unlike previous mentioned movies, this movie is very difficult to follow, the characters are not likable, and even music is not enjoyable. Movie duration becomes excessive under such circumstances where you can't follow anything.

As for the male protagonists, I do not get engaged with them, the performance wasn't good in my opinion, not because of the acting but because of poor writing. In this movie the main character has no tights with no one. No daughters on earth, no beloved ones, no confusion, no twists ...etc. It is very difficult to understand what drives him. It felt like watching a robot !!

Occasionally, I rewatch movies where I feel unfair about my judgement. But frankly Speaking, the simple thought of possibly rewatching it gives me a headache.

I am not sure If Nolan is trying to outsmart us!! Or making us feel like we are intellectually not good enough to understand his work!! It is very confusing ... Probably he needs to rethink again if he correctly passed the narrative and story. I personally think, he failed this time."
A little too much,jesseen,7/10,26 September 2022,"After proving his absolute loyalty in the field, a CIA operative is entrusted with a mission of the highest secrecy: investigating a new physics-defting technology of entropic reversal. His mission pits him against a ruthless Russian arms dealer, whose wife he comes to pity. Can he discover the true nature of his assignment and save everyone he cares for?

If I understand right (which I'm not sure I do), the core mechanism is basically time travel with the gimmick that when you're in the past, things around you move in reverse. And there's no problem with encountering a former version of yourself as long as you don't touch. I suspect the mechanism would break down under close scrutiny.

I think Nolan has hit a tipping point re: the wackiness/complexity of his plots. Inception was wacky, but comprehensible, and very enjoyable. Interstellar was wacky and less comprehensible, but still very enjoyable. But Tenet is so wacky and incomprehensible, the inscrutability harms the enjoyability. I expect he will course-correct after hitting this threshold."
Unintelligible,northernpaladin,4/10,25 September 2022,"I love Christopher Nolans work and see him as one of the outstanding directorial talents of the C21st but this is woeful and after the boring Dunkirk and the fairly average Interstellar one could think he is losing his edge. Some reviews on here have tried to claim that if you don't understand/like the film you are some kind of intellectual pigmy, not only is that clearly insulting it is also wrong headed, it is the director's job to provide us with a narrative that makes sense within the world he has created and offer us characters we can identify enough with to be able to enjoy the journey. In this offering we have story which is completely unfathomable and at times quite stupid that at no time do we really know what is going on or why and by the end we don't know how we got there or whether it was worth it. If we take a similar complex and off kilter offering from Nolan like Inception (or for that matter The Prestige) the plotting logic is clear throughout and although we know it could never be real we accept it because it feels real in the world Nolan has created. Such is not the case with Tenet and although that is largely due to the lack of clarity it is also to do with the performances, Washington is simply not cut out to carry the weight of such a dense movie and spends most of the time looking as confused as we are, Debicki is forgettable and Branagh is dumped with a cardboard cut out Russian oligarch he can do little with, the only bright spot is Pattinson who breezes through the whole thing as if he completely understands everything. Now Nolan has also become known for his spectacular set pieces which punctuate the narrative at the right moment and drive the plot forward, not so here, we have three set pieces, the opera house, the airport and the hidden base, but none of them serve any real purpose other just being big set pieces, this something I'd expect the Russo brothers to do not Christopher Nolan. All in all a disappointing watch and I hope Nolan gets back on track although whether a bio pic is the answer I'm not sure."
Director Christophen Nolan finally got me this time...,gabryant,5/10,24 September 2022,"For the most part, I have enjoyed Nolan''s films, even though his tendency to exposition as people are running and jumping, necessitating me to rewind and turn on the closed captions. I even wear as a badge of honor that I ""got"" Inception.

But Nolan has finally succeeded in confusing me. I'm still trying to figure out what the running backwards stuff signified, other than something about going backwards in time. The final battle scene, though well-staged is a massive exercise in confusing the viewer. Maybe that was Nolan's point.

Nolan always has well executed action sequences, prior complaint about exposition included, and Tenet is no exception. I suppose that you could watch this film for it's action sequences. But without an understanding of it's murky plot? The sequences become meaningless.

Additionally, character motivations have a largely negative impact upon this film? Sator's (Kenneth Branagh) motivation for what he is doing? Weak. In addition to the apparently continuity error of occurring in the past, while everything in the present is okay? Dunno for certain on that one,

But my final analysis on this film is best summed up by Dean Martin, who in a sketch on their old 60's series, said to (Dan) Rowan and (Dick) Martin, ""I lost you at the bakery."" (Google it, can't add the URL.)"
Confusing but very interesting,remcoshtc,9/10,24 September 2022,"The reviews go very different as this movie has plot and screenplay that has to be in your interest. The bad reviews for bad acting is a thing I don't get. The acting was quite good and the plot and confusing scenes are the best points of the movie that shows that time in another way of abuse is something to take serious. Is there a multi universum? Or will a paradox happen? I can say finally a movie that doesn't have a standard ""back-in-time"" personal issue.

To fill up the 600 characters ;) I can go on but that would contain spoilers. 1 tip: Watch the movie twice as it can be to confusing the first time."
Not a great film but definitely an interesting one!,DaGhoulJones,6/10,22 September 2022,"Oh Tenet, haha what are we going to do with you. So I've seen this movie twice now, once in theatres and once at home. After a second viewing and studying the hell out of the plot synopsis on Wikipedia I can say that i kind of get this movie now and I can definitely confirm to myself that I enjoyed it but it is not a great film and definitely not for everyone. Tenet is a very flawed but very interesting film that should only be seen by Nolan die hards, the average movie-goer will HATE this movie but I liked it for it's original concept, I just wish the execution could have been a bit better and a bit more accessible. I just don't think a movie should have to make me look things up to understand it while I'm watching it in order to enjoy it. If you thought inception was confusing then stay the hell away from this one."
"Confusing, self indulgent mess.",Soothin_grain,3/10,22 September 2022,"Maybe I'm getting old, (I'm retired) but this movie was confusingly silly. Some of photography was great. The story was simply this. A rich powerful man is getting old. He's suffering from the stress regarding his own mortality. So he wants to destroy the world (ala If I cant have it, no one will). The good guys want to stop him. Thats it. That is literally the simple plot.

A whole bunch of unnecessary scenes that are edited in a confusing way to trick the audience into thinking its smarter than it actually is. Also the audio was really weird. The audience cant hear the dialog over the weird music."
Great looking and wonderfully acted.,amesmonde,,20 September 2022,"A CIA agent must manipulate the flow of time to prevent an attack from the future that threatens to annihilate the present world.

Director writer Christopher Nolan delivers a visually crisp film, with some spectacular setups. It's entertaining and cerebral, but convoluted in places. It's not a time travel film per-say, more time inversion and temporal paradoxes. The film's cinematography, score, editing, acting and costumes are high quality. It's straight laced, haunting and mesmerising, with echoes of the best of James Bond vibe throughout.

The supporting cast are first rate, leads Washington and Pattinson are outstanding in this backwards-moving, non-linear thinking offering. Branagh's original bad guy is an interesting dysfunctional addition.

Overall, it's grounded sci-fi; quite a simple story, even if a little confusing on the surface. Worth watch for the performances alone."
An incoherent mess from start to finish,amontague-45142,3/10,19 September 2022,"This film is nonsense. The concept throws up so many pseudoscientific concepts any of which aren't even close to interesting. The combination of the forward\reverse action isn't compelling to watch and the story doesn't hold together. Worse stil wastes a talented cast with babbling lines of dialogue that feel like they were fished at random from a hat. The motivation of the antagonist is simply not compelling enough to explain the huge amount of effort he puts into achieving his goals and the brutality he seems to display boils down to him being Russian, one of the few nations stil allowed to be broadly drawn psychopathic villains simply because of where they are from. It's lazy and feels cheap. Honestly the rating reflects the quality that the technical teams put in to the stunts, camera work and sets. The sound mixing is dreadful and I'm glad I streamed this as I had to rewind more than once to hear dialogue, which is pretty unforgivable and must be have been a nightmare in the cinema.

Avoid at all costs, because despite what this film would have you believe, you can't go back..."
Far too stupid for its own good,zenmateisshite,3/10,19 September 2022,"Nolan has proved again that he is a stupid person's idea of a smart person.

He takes basic physics natural phenomena and breaks every law this brain could think of. That could be exciting to make as an action sci-fi movie but in his case it isn't.

In Inception people can influence other people's decisions using dreams and dreams within dreams (OKAY!). In Interstellar love is used to navigate through a black hole (yes I am not kidding), and in Tenet this ""inversion"" malarkey is used to reverse time.

This is yet again a stupid idea that I might have come up with when I was 11. Nolan is a grown man and his ability to convince other grown women and men with his utter nonsensical ideas is stellar. I'll give him that.

His movie making abilities on the other hand are really, really, really overrated and it is painful."
Poor character development and it didn't bring me in.,David431,4/10,19 September 2022,"All but one of the characters were one dimensional. The pseudoscience had no whiteboarding, hopefully there will be a directors cut with a lecture and diagrams. As it stands the story is an excuse to have big explosions and car chases, which is a shame because a lot of locations are very scenic.

The film feels like it was based on a good hook, then it went through a lot of committee stages to remove anything intelligent so it felt confusing at times, intentionally so. Some parts and scenes were good and others not so, and as a result it felt like the film was from parts, made by separate teams stuck together in the cutting room. Generally suffered from too high a budget and not enough work by a couple of capable, focused writers with the director."
Beyond the acceptable complexity,sirieys,5/10,18 September 2022,"There was always going to be a point from which Nolan would fail to capture and retain the attention of audiences. This is it. It's not a bad movie, the acting is good, even the concept is interesting, but I tried to get into the story and connect all the actions but at one point I just gave up and let go. I am sure others will have had the endurance. There is a bit of Lynch's Mulholland Drive here with the second part providing an opportunity to understand fully what's happening to be fair. Maybe it takes a second viewing but where with Inception or Interstellar (or even Memento) this was an exciting perspective, it feels like burden for this one. There had to be a way to make things more within reach, maybe with a simpler plot around the concept."
Far too clever for it's own good,mrglenngrant,4/10,14 September 2022,"This film was everything I expected. And not in a good way.

It's a total brain-ache of a story ... very Nolan-esque you might say. I had to search ""Tenet explained"" after watching it and even after reading numerous articles I'm still not entirely clear what's really going on. Does anyone?

For much of the film it plays as a decent Bond style thriller. So far, so enjoyable. One the inversion stuff kicks in it gets really confusing. We see scenes that played out earlier play out again but from people who are travelling backwards in time's perspective. I'm just about able to grasp how there are three - yes, three - Protagonists in the Oslo turnstile scene. The car chase is one that I don't have the energy to try and understand at this point in the evening. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe I'll cut my losses. And don't get me started on the battle with the temporal pincer movement.

The acting and locations really elevated the film ... however I've always said that a film where you need to watch it more than once to understand - and/or search for explanations after seeing it - has something really wrong with it. I'd wager that anyone who said this film was understandable on first viewing was a Nolanite and a liar. I've seen some reviews that give this film maximum stars - looking at you Cinemablend - and I think they're deluding themselves and just hitting the Nolan coolaid.

It does have some neat and clever time travel elements - don't get me wrong - but the multiple versions of people all co-existing in the same time period with some going backwards and some going forwards and some doing both is just too much and makes the story just to much of a mess to really appreciate. I think if Nolan had dialled things down it would have been a much better film ... but I think that he has such a reputation now that each film has to be more bonkers than the last, unfortunately.

39/100."
Appalling sound recording,kate-foreman-664-656702,4/10,14 September 2022,"Why do film makers seem to be obsessed with overly loud backing tracks to movies? They add nothing to the story and don't move the plot along. On the other hand it did mean you heard less of Kenneth Branagh's appalling 'all purpose one note Russian accent' so that's a plus.

A promising film spoilt by terrible sound recording: this seems to be more and more common lately. Dialogue was either too quiet or the fx and music (which was completely superfluous anyway) drowned it out. There were three of us watching and we gave up by consensus with an hour left to go. Such a pity as it could have been so much better, hence the low score."
Hard to make sense,roxmewild,4/10,10 September 2022,"I think the movie had promise but decided to go down the complex route of revealing the story Right from the start I was unsure what was going on and who was who and what relation they had to one another! This makes for a frustrating movie as you are trying to understand and make sense whilst it continues on and I felt like I was playing catch up the whole time!

I have watched this movie twice and still find parts hard to grasp maybe that was the intention of the writer sadly it only made viewing less enjoyable even the fight scenes are a tad lame as in they actually look like no contact is made which makes it appear quite bland. All in all the hype this movie was given I feel stems from a snobbery factor of people not being able to admit it was overly complicated making it hard to follow and enjoy ."
Laughable,Phillippa_me-me-me,2/10,10 September 2022,"Oh god, where do I even start? Terrible direction, cliche after cliche, embarrassing dialogues, mostly implausible actions and events - do these people not hire consultants to advise them on certain technical aspects while writing the script/filming?!

Not sure why some reviewers are rating it so highly, must be the fast car chase aficionados... In fact, everything is way too fast here, so fast that I often found myself getting lost and not quite comprehending what was being said or how different bits of the story interlocked with each other.

It's a shame, because the premise of this film had some potential. But alas, they managed to make a joke of it all. It's pretty bad, I couldn't watch it until the end."
"I'm a die hard nolanite, but I don't think I'll ever watch Tenet again",fairdraconica,4/10,10 September 2022,"I have to say that I watch everything Nolan makes. I love his unique vision, and I happily watch and re-watch his films and all existing versions of those films. But Tenet doesn't really feel like his film. In comparison to Nolan's intriguing, interesting villains, Tenet's baddie is a cliched, foaming at the mouth psychopath (admittedly, he becomes more coherent within the last 25 minutes, but it's just too late). The main character is not much better, and I just didn't feel much for him at all. I'm not sure it's because of how he was written or if the actor is to blame. I didn't really connect with the vast majority of other characters either. Surprisingly, Neil, the character played by Pattinson was quite interesting, and it's not what I normally say, because I'm not a fan of the actor at all. Yet, I was impressed that he could work with what he was given in this film and make the best out of it. I have no problem with intricate plots, but this one is just hard to follow. Some scenes are more like Michael Bay's garbage than anything that could ever come from Christopher Nolan. The sound effects are horrid in some scenes. The music is good most of the time, but the heavily auto-tuned abomination of a song in the final titles made me roll my eyes. Some people (probably related to the production or distribution this film, one way or another) say that you have to watch Tenet more than once to really get into it, but I just don't want to, and to me it feels like an attempt to make more money. I really don't know what's happened to the film industry of the last few years, but it feels as if all talent is rapidly going out the window."
Complex Cinematography,The-Silver-Shadow,9/10,8 September 2022,"Tenet goes above and beyond your stereotypical cinematography & complexity! Thus is why many of ""user critics"" are writing low-balling reviews, simply because one does not understand the film nor has the intellect to properly dissect the small-to-grand idiosyncrasies composed from beginning-to-end.

If one simply doesn't understand the multi-dimensions of Tenet, don't dismantle a masterpiece just cause it's over-your-head! Embrace the unknown. If you think ""Avengers Endgame"" explains physics better than Tenet, you are confusing sci-fi with actual physics' practices. (Don't get me wrong I love ALL Avengers films). It seems as if any film Watchers & enthusiasts don't have the plot laid out in a rudimentary fashion then it's an automatic negative review. Use your imagination and submerge yourself into the merry-go-round film Tenet, Christopher Nolan is a cinematic marvel guru not for your average viewer with low IQ's."
A masterpiece,ignition1377,10/10,7 September 2022,"Sublime acting, music , screenplay and photography on point.

After watching first time I was not so convinced but the film was so good it made me think and wanting to fully understand so dived in for another 3 times. Director , crew and production geniouses.

A timeless theme about the dimension of time , played to twist your wit in the most exquisite way, putting aside the usual cliche ( or not !!) of geolopolitical issues .

If you want to know a bit more about these concepts, read about philadelphia experiment , remote vision ( started by the soviets) and other de-classified documentations on the experimentation of men vs time and everything will fall into place. Sort of an irony or comical that the artefact capable of destroying our timeline was an algorithm built in a lego like object ."
The rating of this movie shows you the current state of art,mohammad-z,10/10,5 September 2022,"People confuse intelligence with intellect.

If you don't understand this movie you might very well have a high level of intelligence, but you surely lack intellect. Especially if you don't want to understand this movie.

You have to watch it twice, at least, because the second time you know the for your time linear ending and can view the movie simultaneously forwards and backwards.

Many reviewers think the movie is bad because ""they"" didn't grasp the concept of it, they are stuck in linear thinking. Not challenging themselves. Fun fact: Same reviewers complaining about Tenet having ""unreal"" or ""false physics"" concepts, love every Sci-Fi movie packed with impossible nonsense (according to their wording) or Spiderman movie."
Just not very good. Actually terrible!,jbla-75984,1/10,3 September 2022,"It really is terrible acting. That applies all around but who decided that JD Washington should be the lead in any movie. Let alone an actor. His father, Denzel Washington, is amazing but nepotism doesn't make his son a better actor than a pro football player. Also, can't believe the Oscar for special effects honestly. It was sooo obvious that the reverse effects were just rolling film backwards. Seriously, did anyone listen to the soundtrack before they released the movie? A sci-fi movie is supposed to reflect the possibilities the future could bring but the writers had no scientific concept of time travel and resulting paradoxes (let alone good dialog). Even opening your mind to fantastic possibilities in order to enjoy the fun of what could be makes you realize that what the movie presents is just not possible. It's just dumb."
Either love it or hate it,sunilpsagar,9/10,2 September 2022,"I have to confess, i am no Nolan fan and I hated his last three movies. Saw this one on Amazon prime and man this is the best from Nolan for me in over a decade. The take of time travel is great. Just like any dimension, you can go move forward or backward on an axis which I loved. The movie makes more and more sense every time you watch. There is no mindless action or generic men who shoot like they are blind. The plots challenge your thought process and takes multiple viewing to comprehend for a normal human being.

It avoids or mocks most of the cliche in secret agent movies. The acting was a bit of a let down and Nolan's casting is just different* The music is just amazing."
Disappointingly above average from a writer and director I expect more from,nscoby93,7/10,1 September 2022,"This is going to be the hardest review for me to write but I have to be honest and I have to stop reviewing Nolan's films with the fanboy goggles I always have on, that was the point of this marathon.

I've seen Tenet now multiple times since it's home release and everytime I get ready to watch it I always think I'll like it more than last time. Unfortunately this just isn't the case. I'll get all the positives done first. This film is absolutely gorgeous, Nolan is in top fashion here from a film making standpoint. Amazing cinematography, fantastic acting, and a great score. But while I thought the score was great personally I felt Hans Zimmer's absence and really wish he was around.

John David Washington gave a great performance as the protagonist, though he maybe the protagonist the star of the film in this criticics opinion is Robert Pattinson. He just owned the screen in every scene he was in and his character was the better written character in the film. But both Washington and Pattinson had great chemistry, they played off each other very well. The supporting cast isn't asleep here either. Kenneth Branagh played the role of Sator very well, he was truly menacing. Michael Caine in his small role was great but why is in this film? He's just wasted talent here. Aaron Taylor-Johnson gave a great performance as well in his role as Ives, I've really come to like him as an actor and hope to see him in more serious roles.

Yet with all these positives this is unfortunately the weakest thing Nolan I think has written. While the story is intriguing and makes for some great action sequences on film. Nolan's explanation of the key plot element in the entire film is extremely weak. The man who explained things fantastically in Inception can't take the time to explain the complexities of inversion. Granted inversion maybe more complex than anything in Inception but Nolan is a better writer than this. It seems to me Nolan was so focused on making this film the beautiful spectacle it was he forgot the key thing of and I know everyone hates it ""exposition"" it's not a bad word and sometimes it's important.

It gives me no pleasure to say all these things, as a huge fan of Nolan's who has pretty much loved every one of his films this is just rather disappointing. At the end of it all this film is just Christopher Nolan running wild all over the screen with the huge budget of $200 million dollars. Also I know for a fact Nolan has done better on way less. But one thing that cannot be denied is the man sure does know how to put on a spectacle.

Nonetheless Christopher Nolan is still one of the best directors out there. This film is just not the best he's done. All the same I look forward to Nolan's next film Oppenheimer.

Demands multiple viewings,anselmdaniel,7/10,29 August 2022,"This review contains spoilers.

Tenet is a science fiction action thriller movie that premiered in 2020. The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan and stars John David Washington as the Protagonist. An attack from the future occurs where objects from the future have reverse entropy and travel into the past.

Tenet is an impressive action movie. This is a movie that screams classic Christopher Nolan with impressionable action scenes that are creative in concept and execution. The movie executes these action scenes with simple concepts but it merges them into a complex package. For example, a plane heist occurs where the agents investigate a vault location. They discover someone else is already in the vault and have a reverse fight scene. There are many small touches that the movie does that make each of the scenes have a more complex quality to it. Almost all of the action scenes have this quality to it and the scenes have added depth because of this. Tenet's action scenes are almost perfectly made for a cult following.

The fault with Tenet would be its lackluster characters. I feel that this is a problem with Christopher Nolan's writing as many of his characters do not resonate emotionally with the audience. This occurred in other Christopher Nolan written movies where the protagonists do not have much depth. Tenet is no different with how the movie employs its characters. There are basic motivations with the characters driving the events. This is not to say that the acting is poor. John David Washington does a phenomenal job as the protagonist. There was a lack of drama that could have elevated the movie to a classic.

The time travel and reversal is one of the best and worst aspects of the movie. The movie utilizes the reversal incredibly with all of the action scenes involving it in some way. The plot is also rife with lots of reversals that impact the way the story plays out. The reversal is impressive but it requires multiple viewings to understand. Good movies with replayability have the audience learning something new about a character or scene. In this movie, a repeated viewing is required to understand character intentions. The characters reverse time and change motivations. This is clear with the villain changing motivations when he was first a bystander. Multiple watches to understand the plot are an annoyance as the story does not gain more depth.

I would recommend ""Tenet"" directed by Christopher Nolan.

Grade: B."
Pretty Pretty Pretty Good,edhutchinson-08617,7/10,24 August 2022,It's a really good movie but it's at least 30 minutes too long. If it was shorter I'd give it a higher rating. Like many other movies that I fond are way too long. The concepts are very interesting.
Mindfully Blowing! Run It Back.,hugo_hilux,7/10,23 August 2022,"Tenet is a concept movie, both in terms of the concepts it develops and in terms of how those ideas deftly influence the narrative's structure. Time is the key to understanding that idea since it flows and may be altered in accordance with the laws of this planet. Tenet's entire design is closely related to the inverted passage of time, much like how Inception bases its heist format on the idea of dream levels rather than vault intrusion. The more you comprehend the inner workings of Tenet, the more obvious it will become where the world is going, which makes for an enjoyable voyage for the viewer.

A calm and assured CIA agent (John David Washington) solely known as the Protagonist receives this unfavorable information. Then it is revealed to him that some items that are dispersed over the globe are traveling backwards in time; they were created in the future and are now travelling into the past. Clémence Poésy, an exposition-spouting physicist, has figured out that these ""inverted"" artifacts are the remains of a war that will be waged centuries from now but that would nonetheless wipe out all of history in some way that I didn't comprehend. You get it? No, so did I, but the point is that it resembles a game of dominoes more than a nuclear catastrophe.

It is yet another amazing addition to Nolan's body of work. It serves as a successful illustration of the appeal of standalone, non-serialized original storytelling in a world when franchises and sequels rule blockbuster movies. Tenet, however, is Christopher Nolan's ""safest"" film in some time, despite the fact that it breaks new ground. Tenet, the director's third ambitious feature, feels a little staid, as if Nolan's aesthetic were a franchise rather than a framework. Despite this, it nevertheless manages to be more engaging than the majority of tentpole films and serves as a showcase for the director's talents. Tenet serves as an excellent reminder of the potential of blockbuster filmmaking at a time when cinema is perhaps going through its most challenging period in its history. Tenet serves as a great reminder of the potential of blockbuster cinema and the benefits of watching it in a big, dark space."
Great movie if your intelligent enough to follow along,rignahhh,10/10,22 August 2022,"Anyone who rates this movie below a 7 is seriously lacking intelligence. Most people leaving negative reviews admit to either not watching the entire movie or simply not understanding the movie. Is the movie difficult to follow along? Yes... but that's the point of the movie... ""ignorance is our ammunition"" isn't just a phrase for the protagonist, but it's the state we're supposed to be in during a large majority of the movie.

We're given pieces to the puzzle during the film that don't quite match up, but by the end everything falls into place perfectly... and that... is a satisfying feeling. That's the genius of the movie. I will admit this movie isn't for everyone, if you're someone who doesn't like to think too hard you'll hate it, but otherwise it's a must watch."
.taerg saw sihT,collinsgamertv,8/10,22 August 2022,"I don't know why anybody hated this, and thought it was confusing. I perfectly understood it. The score was great, the acting was great, just everything was really good!"
Another movie with !,johnbrandt-27777,1/10,21 August 2022,The people making the movie said nothing bad about it while filming it a lot of hype! But I've watched it twice thinking I misses the plot but nope 👎 it isn't there ! The worst movie I've seen in about 5 years. It's too bad because I was waiting for it to come out but disappointed once again!
Brilliant scope but reached too far,georgeski-35277,7/10,18 August 2022,"I am a massive fan of Christopher Nolan and all his work. This film, for me, was fantastic and everything I would want from a Nolan film. However, my girlfriend was completely confused and could not continue watching as the concepts and issues tackled in the film was so complex and the explanation was patchy at best. Great for movie fans and those who like complex story lines, not great for anyone who wants a casual experience."
Don't expect too much,Zhi-ling,7/10,17 August 2022,"The movie is hard to understand, but that's okay. You can watch it twice. But I have no interest in seeing it again. It's not like Inception. There are a lot of exciting scenes in the movie, but I don't even feel the tension. The characters are boring."
Hard to understand,wkvmjzzpd,8/10,16 August 2022,Hard to understand but if you watch ten3t 2 times you can understand the film. I like this film. Story is intresting. The performances of the actors are good. But I cant understand the end of the film.
unsatisfactory,Shzh-demaoong,7/10,15 August 2022,"Nolan is telling us what Inception would be like if it didn't work out.

The visuals are great, but I still get distracted sometimes, and the characters are boring. Although you can see a lot of effort put into the film, the overall effect is not satisfactory."
Time travel like no other,ddouglas793,10/10,15 August 2022,This movie was da bomb...no pun intended. Nolan outdid himself here...Master piece! Unbelievable writing and so was the casting and the acting! Way more than what I expected. Now I'm gonna have watch Inception...Just like to know if it is even comparable to Tenet since I read recently that Inception was a perfect movie with a twist and I love movies that can keep you on the edge of your seat which is literally where Tenet had me.
Pseudoscientific mumbojumbo,gthyni,1/10,14 August 2022,"Lots of action but I lost interest in the plot b/c the insistence of ""scientific"" explanations that was just word salad. Films do not have to be realistic but this one took pretentiousness way too far."
Concept,greatsr,9/10,14 August 2022,"Perhaps Tenet is the weakest film in Nolan's career. He looks great in the trailer, and is no longer so intricate after 20 minutes of viewing. Yes, the denouement is excellent, the camera work is done at an unrealistic level. But there really is no plot here, the cast is not the strongest, perhaps only Robert Pattinson and Kenneth Branagh stands out. I expected something more, apparently Nolan raised the bar too much. If you compare Tenet with that Inception, then complete degradation in all aspects is on the face."
P.O.S.,quarternoteholdings,1/10,14 August 2022,"Wow. 2.5 hours of my life I'll never get back.

I like JD Washington but he needs to pick better scripts. I mean I know it was Covid time but seriously doing nothing would have been better.

And Christopher Nolan, you should be ashamed that your name is tied to this. Although most of your stuff is pretty out there anyway. If it wasn't for Batman you'd be looking at a catalog of Too Bad.

Do yourself a favour and watch something else. There's many choices and unfortunately mine was a big mistake."
Nolans weakest film,travola-35109,7/10,13 August 2022,"The story pretty much means nothing. You won't care about the characters either. It's like Nolan cranked up the things people complain most about his films. It's loud and you can't hear anyone, the story is weak, weak characters, etc etc.

That being said it's obviously a beautiful film. It's a sleek (super sleek) spy thriller. The set pieces are fun and entertaining. If you just watch it as a fun spy thriller with cool things to look at you'll be fine. Don't look for deeper meaning or try and understand the science in this one because none of it makes sense. If it didn't look great and the action scenes weren't fun and I wasn't a big Nolan fan it would probably be a 5.

I also really like John David Washington and I want him to be a big star so I gotta give it some love because he's great in the role and I hope he does more action films."
🤔 What? Who? 🤔 Intense movie,znsfh,8/10,13 August 2022,"Likely would have been a 10 if I fully understood it. Loved the idea and the action. Brilliant!

Read some reviews and somehow I now know less. Sator Square?

Halfway through I just excepted that I don't understand and let myself experience one of the most amazing action scenes to the end. It came together in the last half hour.

It's an awesome movie that is very unique and the action scenes will impress you."
See it for what it is.,tlght,8/10,12 August 2022,"First, it's Christopher Nolan. So you know that you will have to watch the movie twice. Second, it's Christopher Nolan, so there's Easter eggs. Third, it's (yeah you know it) Christopher Nolan, so if your looking for the predictable format in entertainment, don't watch Nolan movies...

That being said, I enjoyed the architecture of it. Understanding the scenes from both perspectives, The logic of going through the motions, to assure the outcome. Very mathematic in it's form of thinking, once you get it, you see the originality.

To respect the format, it couldn't have been done any other way and to enjoy the movie, you have to be in a cerebral, who's done it, kind of mood."
Watching this feels like working on a test,daryopeek,7/10,12 August 2022,"Okay! I get it the director is smart. The movie has interesting concept and several scenes are amazing. However, I think I can't grasp the idea well because the pace and dialogues are too fast. They spoke like in those politics roundtable discussion, thus in the midway I can't follow any of the plot. Maybe I'm too dumb for this movie. I still can enjoy the action though, but not entertained at all. I expect people would love to watch this movie again to make sense the whole story, but I feel like one time is enough. It's like working on a test from a subject I don't understand. I only want to take it once."
Ancient Sator Square,Kapyong,7/10,11 August 2022,"Haven't read all 5 thousand posts to check if someone has already mentioned this, but keywords of this movie come from an ancient 5 word square :

SATOR AREPO TENET OPERA ROTAS

Goes back even to ancient Rome, search ""Sator square""."
Loved it! Needs rewatching to fully understand,manonlemieux,9/10,9 August 2022,"I love when movies are different, even if they fail. For me this was a hit. But like other hard to understand the first time movies, like Mission Impossible, I know I'll watch it again and again and catch more things. I love The Gray Man but it's not super original, this is. Had me right out the gate."
Definitely worst Nolan film to date,vdmascarenhas,6/10,8 August 2022,"The concept is great. It's not time travel, but reversed entropy. But the plot is over complicated, or at least too boring to follow. The acting (apart from the villain) is passable. Soundtrack that usually is superb in Nolans movies is blant. I'm a big fan of Nolan, but he overdone himself in this one."
Everything but the sound.,johnorval,8/10,8 August 2022,"Just watched for the second time, on tv. The balance between the voices and all the other sounds, especially the music, is appalling. This certainly does not help anyone to understand what is going on.

It is visually impressive and contains exciting action sequences. The relationshipsbetween the characters could be described as ""British reserved"".

It deserves a rewatch or two, helped by a reading of the clues that others have written about.

It does not suffer from black screen time as some modern movies do, but, like too many, the sound balance and clarity of vocals is sub par, hence the drop to eight stars."
Another overblown nolan disaster,blond1000,1/10,6 August 2022,"After 10 minutes i was lost, after 60 minutes i was completely lost. After 100 minutes i was in the land of the bewildered, totally! Nolan has a very fertile imaginative mind but he doesnt seem to understand that movies are made for entertainment not for angst and frustration. Like INCEPTION this needs to be watched several times to be understood and even then too many questions remain unanswered. INTERSTELLAR should have/could have been a great movie but like tenet, was totally ruined by incessant loud noise passed off as music score, so bad, loud and annoying that dialogue could not be understood. Such a great pity, visuals were great, but thats all!"
"Hello, I am very suave",aguinness-48908,4/10,6 August 2022,"Whitty dialogue that's delivered woodenly quick and complete with multiple smirks - check

Cheesey characters pompously swanning around exchanging deep secrets within seconds of meeting to help the storyline - check

What? - check

Like mate, I can't make a smooth good video on tiktok but for goodness sake just slow the conversation down and make it seem at least a bit natural, rather than a formality that needs to be rushed to get to the next bravado scene."
Who knows what the heck is going on?,pdollak,5/10,5 August 2022,"The bigger problem is, who cares?

Really. It's not clear who anyone is, why they are doing whatever it is they are doing and, as stated at the outset, what the heck is going on."
"Excels in technical filmaking, drags in storyline",wlee08,6/10,5 August 2022,"Interesting concept lends itself to a demonstration of technical filmaking, especially in the special effects department, but doesn't lend itseld to a very good story. Some of the scenes crawl to a snails pace while we struggle to connect with any character drama, while the huge scenes, complete with explosions and car chases - scenes we are usually meant to sit back and enjoy - leave us in a state of confusion because of the backwards/forwards thing. Watching it again doesn't seem like it would help either, as its clear the writers felt free to pretty much bend the rules of this game.

I have no problem with bending the sci-fi rules, but how do you overlook the obvious stuff - like milllions of dollars (perhaps billions) in gold bullion bars being transported on a regular freight airline without any security, seemingly being pushed around on carts by airport maintenance workers? Even within the first minute something seemed off, as the musicians tuning their instruments at the opera are brought to a sudden hush. If you've heard orchestras tuning up before performance you will know what I mean - theres always one or two instruments that are still tuning for a second or two. They never come to a unanimous quiet on a dime like that. Any musician on set could have pointed this out."
Passing Thrills,danielfletcher121,7/10,4 August 2022,"Nolan has become the Harrods of blockbusters. Delivering a premium range of action movies. As such, with high-end fashion, the raw materials have been taken through a transformative process to produce a high quality item. However, you may say to yourself, I know the quality is there, but it looks a little weird. Can I see myself enjoying it on more than one occassion? You might get the initial thrill and admiration, but it won't replace that slightly cheaper, more enduring item that you will revisit time over.

Tenet brings to mind the concept of plural ignorance. Are we saying it's great because we think that we are supposed to, that we just assume that everyone is sycophantic about these overly complex ideas and that we are all afraid to say, 'actually you're talking rubbish there Chris'.

The acting is brilliant, the stunts are high octane hypnosis, whilst the last hour feels like watching a school boy return home and tell their parents everything he learnt in physics class that day.

Love Chris Nolan. Enjoy his films. But would love to see him just make a really good James Bond or Mission Impossible."
Artistry,coilfyzx,9/10,4 August 2022,"The thing that I love about Nolan, is that he seemingly does his best to totally disregard the QC checklist of a movie. Personally, personally I loved the artistry of the movie. I wish I could go in depth without sounding like I'm whining on his behalf but here we go.

I asked myself the questions 1. Does Christopher Nolan know how to ensure that vocals and language are clear in a film? Yes, he's done it before, it's a hallmark of his work.

2. Does he know how to develop characters such that the audience knows and relates to the protagonist? Adding; such that we also can predict to varying degrees plot reveals? Yes he can, he's done it countless times.

3. Does he know how to prepare the minds of the audience for the plot that is to come? Yes....must I repeat?

So if an accomplished Director ""drops the ball"" in any many of these areas, do we call it a bad film, overly clever...or do we not assume intention perhaps?

I'll agree Nolan's films aren't for everyone and some people will hate it, they are allowed to. Personally I see his supposed disregard for fundamentals as a fresh approach to story telling. I can always expect a niche experience. All the ""flaws"" of this movie felt very premeditated. I mean this was a movie of two melding time runs. So of course he experimented the HELL out of the pacing, how much we knew and when we knew it. Nolan's movie accomplishes one thing every time, they let you FEEL what it must be like to be in the film. Not knowing and understanding is kinda the point of the film, right? When we finally get told the effect that making that directional switch has, we understand that vision hearing and understanding are blurred. So when WE can't get the details at times doesn't that make you feel like you also made that switch? Should we be surprised that he attempted to give us that experience? In fact weren't we all watching this in reverse? The fact that it all made perfect sense gradually as the movie went on whilst ""missing"" dialogue is proof in my book of his intentions! Controlling the experience like Nolan does is something I'm not sure we're already for.

Boiled down therefore, what Christopher Nolan did was read us two bed time stories simultaneously, one in reverse word after word...That is artistry in my books. Writing and Directorial prowess. Captivating! It felt wholly original. Mind you, he is a psychopath for even attempting this, but I love it. More please."
Had to watch 3 times to understand (a bit),apietruchapoczta,6/10,4 August 2022,"I was mostly confused watching it for the first time, a bit confused watching for the second time and pretty convinced that I understand this plot the third time. I think it's a bit too complicated, it's an action movie in the end. I appreciate the effort though."

I gave 10 for everything for Interstellar movie."
Expensive incoherent Waste of money and Time,ocacia,3/10,3 August 2022,"A film has a purpose! Like it or love it films have limits. And the gift of any artists is how they are able to communicate through film what they want to communicate. Just because a film bends forward and backwards and ""challenges our mind"" does not make it a masterpiece. It is just a expensive film that bends our mind. Hidden in all of the chaos of this film is poor storytelling. Why does he care so much about that woman and her child? So the motivations are not clear. All respect to Denzel's son but he is very bland and uninteresting. I did Like Kenneth and even Debicki. But within all this mind bending pretentious nonsense there still is no serious story. I did not care as the stakes were not put up high enough to make me care if they won or loss. It is not Dunkirk where you felt they were saving the world. I was not rooting for anyone. Nolan is not pushing boundaries he is just spinning off of Inception. And it is a flop. I cannot remember the music either, only the credits track. There are films you watch and you want to understand the meaning so bad, this is not one of them. Inception worked because within its complexity was a solid story. With solid acting. Please stop giving Nolan blind loyalty so he might rethink his next flick.

Technically the dialogue is very hard to hear at times. I had to put up my center channel to 7Db and the volume was all over the place. The fight scenes look so fake, like Matrix 2 and 3."
Another interesting topic ruined by a loud annoying soundtrack,boblin2-1,3/10,2 August 2022,"Per the title of the review, annoying, loud, droning, soundtracks have become a Christopher Nolan trademark. As soon as I see his name on the movie, its off my list of movies to see at the theater. Tenet was one such movie. I watched it this evening on Netflix. I had to turn the volume right down and switch on the subtitles. So, now I've seen it. I will never watch it again, nor will I recommend it, and its all down to the horrible soundtrack.

In summary, Christopher Nolan does it again; makes a movie on an interesting topic and then spreads droning, loud, painful, music all over the dialogue, great. Thanks for nothing!"
Tenet Predicted the Future,demiller74,10/10,1 August 2022,"I thought Tenet was a bizarre nonsensical movie, then February 24th 2022 happened. There are so many dang parallels that makes me think Noland distilled Vlad^2 and wrote this movie. Heck he based the Joker on another world leader who robbed banks, killed the help, and didn't care about $ so I shouldn't be surprised, right? Still makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck."
Could have been good...,monica-cohn08,4/10,31 July 2022,"What a mess this movie is. I watched it on demand which meant I could stop and rewind when I was confused, which was often. I enjoyed some of the action sequences and the movie would have been better if it stuck to that without all that ""inversion"" BS. After awhile I stopped paying attention and just wanted it to end because I WAS interested in seeing how things turned out. Film buffs may find the last part interesting with the combination of forward and backward special effects. I must be dim-witted because I still don't understand how the world was saved, (""spoiler"")..."
"Slightly mind bending, lots of fun",alex-17861,8/10,30 July 2022,"So having seen a lot of reviews for this film (lots negative), I was a bit worried. Let's be clear, its not one of the great films of cinema or even the best Nolan film. But it's interesting, makes you think a bit, has great action, good cast, and looks lovely. It does benefit from a 2nd viewing mind!"
Only Nolan can('t) do this,netmedia-1,10/10,30 July 2022,"A story which is too much to be told with a movie, or by any means available to humans. This is why it's a messy masterpiece. It deserves a 10/10 for pushing boundaries in a remarkabke way."
No one talks like this,pdc15725,4/10,30 July 2022,"The female characters in the movie seem to speak without inflection, at low volume, and with zero personality. The male characters aren't much better but at least you can hear them. Unfortunately, even if you can get past this, the plot makes little sense."
"A very good movie, a failure for Nolan",tancrevena,8/10,30 July 2022,"This movie is a very well built story, however, if we compare it to the other Christopher Nolan's movies, it emerges as one of the worst. Tenet has a different feeling from the others: although the plot seems very intricate and difficult to understand, the real problem lies in the characters: the evolution of some of these is non existing and so they result flat and boring throughout the movie. The only relationship that can be found is the one between Andrei and his wife Kat, however it's not interesting because it wasn't given enough depth. In Interstellar we have the father-daughter realtionship between Cooper and Murph; in Inception we have the husband-wife deal between Cobb and Mal and in The Prestige we have the rivalry between Borden, Angier and the love for their wives. Also the acting was not on a ""Nolan level"" this time: Kenneth Branagh seems unnatural in most of his anger scenes and the actors didn't have to deliver strong performance moments, such as in Interstellar and Inception. Furthermore, in all Nolan's movies there has always been a strong female character, since Memento; but in Tenet Kat's character is rough and not explored in depth. Keeping out the characters, Tenet is a brilliant movie with the incredible idea of time inversion and it's spectacular regarding the special effects on the big screen; Göransson's soundtrack is also always on point.

In conclusion I feel that this is a really great movie but a failure for Christopher Nolan because it fails in the aspects that made this director strong: the characters, and not only the complicated and impossible to understand plots. Just remember how he could turn a well known character such as Batman in an incredible, never told, story."
I never really felt connected to this film and I really wanted to like it.,planktonrules,4/10,28 July 2022,"""Tenet"" is a Christopher Nolan film that came out in the middle of COVID...so it didn't get the sort of theatrical release you'd expect. In fact, it very quickly came to cable and DVD.

The story is a very difficult one to both explain and connect with as you watch. It involves some sort of secret agent and his mission to somehow stop someone from sending items through time. Obviously some evil persons from the future and some from the present are in league together. What is NOT obvious is pretty much everything else about the movie! It is incredibly ambiguous and annoying...much of which is because you really have no idea who the 'Protagonist' (John David Washington) is working for, who he is or, well, pretty much ANYTHING about him. Calling him 'Protagonist' throughout the movie really heightens this problem.

In many ways, this is much like the rest of the story...vague and detached. As a result, it was very difficult to connect with anyone nor care about them. All you are left with are some insane stunts and a lot of action...and, oddly, an amazingly boring film. I really wanted to like this one...but it just felt as if the film wasn't meant to be enjoyed by most folks...just the few."
Back to the Future,albertval-69560,5/10,27 July 2022,"I agree with many of the reviews here. The story is over-complicated, chaotic and really confusing what with the moving forward and backward in time.

I wasn't inclined to watch it again a second time because it was so frustrating watching it the first time. The ending didn't clearly tell the viewer what happened except for Neil to say that ""what happened happened."" Duh.

The sci-fi gobbledygook (entropy of time, temporal pincer movement, turnstiles) was over the top and the viewer needed to be a physicist like Neill to understand the goings-on.

I admire the work of Christopher Nolan, particularly, the Batman movies, but this one is inscrutable. And he even wrote the story."
"Bad movie, don't recommend",buizelxd,3/10,26 July 2022,"Horrible.

I saw lots of movie a lot of them boring, but this movie made me sad and mad, i a way that made me write this review.

Ok so everyone is speaking of this movie and recommended me this one.

Everyone talked about how masterpiece it is or really hard to understand is this but the fact is, it isn't.

Why?

What i have to say is this: i was really focused to understand this and a lot of things don't come a long. It is not because of the fact that is hard but the fact that you don't get all the information you need for it to understand it.

The premise and the main idea is great but they should put a better description on why this is happening and how is happening because that Grandpa paradox was just a tiny bit of the whole process.

The characters we're well developed, the choreography behind it was amazing. The plot was 'meh' as i said before. Music was great and the plot twist were least expected final Rate 3/10 i wouldn't recommend this to any of my friends."
Confusing,tiituspoykk,5/10,18 July 2022,"Hard to follow, didn't know what or why things were happening 70% of the time. This was cool as a concept but the execution could have been more user friendly. Felt like they didn't explain the story enough for me to really get hooked on to it.

The score by Travis Scott was good and the ending was also a pleasant but overall, not that particularly great of a movie."
The Grandfather Paradox,Mateo-EGC,7/10,18 July 2022,"A complex feature film, especially for those who are unfamiliar with the topics that the film deals with, such as time travel.

Although the first part is weak in certain aspects in which it can get boring, like not understanding anything that happens, in the second half the plot is better understood to reach a great ending. Christopher Nolan is a master with his action scenes, which saves the first half is entertaining, and then demonstrate how great it is to bring to film topics such as time travel.

This film is a clear mix of so many genres that Nolan has brought to the movies, although it is understandable that not everyone likes these combinations."
Nolan's first film that I truly hate.,TrueCriticism,,18 July 2022,"6.9

Tenet is a very well executed film. It has a great concept and it's execution is by no means incredible, squeezing every ounce of juice from said concept to leave a lasting impression on your mind. That being said, it's not good. There are many problems with this film, such as it's runtime and pacing. This movie is a little hard to rate, but it's very clear that this movie is not his greatest.

Unlike some of his other movies, Tenet is completely devoid of emotion. The characters are not very interesting to the point where a soap opera would have characters with more depth. This is very, very disappointing if you include the fact that most of Nolan's movies were full to the brim will all kinds of emotions and characters that you can remember.

Another problem with this movie is that Nolan may have gotten to carried away with the concept. It's a very interesting one at that, but it's also a bit complicated to the point where multiple videos had to be created for the audience to understand. As I pointed out in my review for Doctor Strange 2, you shouldn't complicate things to the point where the viewer must do their homework to fully enjoy a movie, even though that is what the MCU has become.

In conclusion, Tenet is a great film with a great concept, but it seems that it's greatest weakness was the person who created the movie in the first place."
Poor Sound,nanobot-90-272383,5/10,15 July 2022,"Looked interesting the first time, but could not follow dialogue (I read Nolan made it hard to hear for a reason). Between the bad sound and overly complicated reversed time, not worth re-watching."
Really cool,jasminn_tan,7/10,11 July 2022,"Really cool idea but I think I might be too dumb for this movie. I love a good time paradox movie or show and I understood what happened on a surface level but it was still confusing to me. Even so, I had fun watching the action scenes and how the scenes played out in reverse. Truly an interesting experience."
The sound has been done by an unpaid intern. That's how it feels.,uvraver,4/10,10 July 2022,"The over dubbing is so poor. No character talks over another so you can tell the actors dubbed alone.

This results in a loss of atmosphere and a real amateur feel to the film.

The concept is brilliant and I bet there is no logical mistakes. Pre-planning meant there was no budget left for sound.

But the concept is played out in a simplistic back story.

Shows how hard it is to make a clever and great film I suppose."
Just Absorb the effects don't overthink it,lakings97,6/10,10 July 2022,"Tenet is a Christopher Nolan movie that he wrote, directed and produced. This is the first movie from Chris that I didn't care for much. The script was overly complicated and hard to follow. John David Washington was the actual Protagonist, he acted as the good guy but he was actually a bad guy but you don't know it. Robert Pattinson acts as his British counterpart to help the survival of the world from those who travel back in time to make a change at a certain point to our timeline. Kenneth Branagh played the Russian Oligarch who wants to change the timeline. The cast also included cameos from Michael Caine and Wes Chatham. Overall great concept with great special effects especially we reverse slo mo action sequences, but this isn't a movie I would watch again."
If I could turn back time,NPIan,1/10,9 July 2022,"That's two hours and twenty three minutes (one hundred and forty three minutes in total) of my life I won't get back. Or will I?

Absolutely complete and utter tosh."
Incomprehensible tosh,songtsan,4/10,8 July 2022,"I love sci Fi and will watch any movie but I think this was "" the emperor has no clothes"" they came up with a single theme and tried to make it into a movie like . Inception it is not however and tries to be way to clever for itself rather than create possibly a way more comprehensible and flowing movie."
A late review after my second time watching this greatness!,khalidmoubile,9/10,7 July 2022,"Tenet.

""Christopher Nolan in his lastest movie adopting the time inversion hypothesis, it's about an unnamed protagonist and his journey through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that defines time differently.""

This is my second time watching this supernatural masterpiece and I'm as shocked as I was after the first or even more!

I remember that people kept saying that Nolan exaggerated in terms of making his film complicated to be fully understood, and all the bad feedbacks about Tenet, but man don't you see how wonderful this project is? How it's perfectly executed?

I just realized that this is absolutely the best directing in an action /sci-fi movie I've ever had the pleasure to watch!

The action scenes were fantastic for a sci-fi film, but the inverted action scenes were too perfect and too much for a human's brain.

Besides the excellence of directing, screenplay isn't a weak part, it might have some problems in terms of explaining more what we saw in this film, but Nolan has trusted us to get every piece of his puzzle, And I'm telling you after watching it two times, a couple of pieces are missing!

The storyline was full of twists, Mind-blowing ones, the dialogs weren't the best thing about this movie, a little bit ""over symbolic "".

Christopher Nolan isn't the only protagonist of this film, the charismatic John David Washington and the amazing Robert Pattinson are included, their action scenes were perfectly performed as their dialogs, I loved the chemistry and the partnership between the too actors and characters.

Elizabeth Debicki did well either , but their was a problem in her relationship with the protagonist, it's maybe the first time I witness a disappointing fail of Nolan to make one of his movies strong dramatically.

Finally the question is, Did Christopher Nolan reached his brain's limits after this film or he can go farther. Anyway I'm ready for his futuristic projects, and I can't wait to watch more of this man's work."
