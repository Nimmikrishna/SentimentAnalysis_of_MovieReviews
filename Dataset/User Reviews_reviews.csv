" Not for all, but for some
",ZinedineElbaroni,8,13 March 2023,"Tenet is a cinematic masterpiece that takes you on an exciting and surprising journey through time and space. From the first scene you are immersed in a world of intrigue and danger that keeps you in suspense throughout the film. Be told. The action sequences are really good, and the visual effects are great.The cast is phenomenal, with John David Washington giving an outstanding performance in the lead role. Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki also excel in their respective roles, bringing depth and nuance to their characters.But what sets Tenet apart is his sheer ambition. This is a movie that demands your full attention and rewards you for it. Challenge.In short, Tenet is a love letter to cinema, an exhilarating ride that pushes the boundaries of what is possible on screen. If you're looking for a breathtaking film that keeps you pondering its mysteries long after the credits roll, look no further than Tenet."
" Damned good try
",xyqkp,7,10 March 2023,"Putting aside the ham-handed effort to explain the physics, which was unavoidable since it's clear no physicist was ever asked to look at the plausibility of the script, the overall premise wasn't awful. The first 30-45 minutes quite muddled the premise by trying to create suspense where there was no need for any yet; choosing to open with a James Bond spy ambience was the wrong choice. And, oddly, in the end the very premise itself completely eliminated any suspense in the ending (because, we knew the world wasn't going to be deleted, so we knew almost to the smallest detail what was going to happen). That's not really a failure on this movie's fault; such circuitous and ""destiny"" oriented premises always run that risk. With such premises you need to look for suspense in some fashion other than the question of whether destiny is real or not. The ""destroy everything or nothing"" premise could not be the key suspense point. If, for example, they'd focused the critical ending question of where the protagonist and the girl would get together, they'd have posed a question that could go either way ... and therefore been suspenseful. I've only ever seen one ""end of the world"" movie where focus successfully stayed on whether the world would end or not ... and surprisingly, it did ... and then more surprisingly, it didn't.Clearly a WHOLE lot of effort was put into thinking through the visual implications of forward/backward time travel. Some very inventive chase and fight scenes, and especially seeing the same sequences played out first in forward time and then again later in reverse time. A huge scripting effort and an even greater, monumental continuity effort. Unfortunately, as one might expect for a task this large and complex, there were quite a few perspective failures. But, perhaps, the greatest failure was in audio. Faces covered in masks (perhaps a bit stupid overkill-one asks why air needed to be reversed when literally nothing else in the forward world needed to be) are fine visualizations, but in a movie this fast paced, all I can say is I'm damned glad I streamed it so I could go back over and over again: in a theater, mumbled clues to a complex story like this is the same thing as not bother to explain anything. People can't concentrate the necessary effort for two hours on hearing, listening, and understanding without getting migraines. The movie was clearly not shown to anyone not already familiar with the premise before editing was complete. The movie would gone up 2 ratings on IMDB if people had actually heard and understood the details of the premise and its implications, but alas far too many reviews were posted here by people who either couldn't spend the effort to understand or wouldn't.Any time you combine a frenzied presentation with a complex premise like time travel with no meaningful opportunity to pause and think, you're just going to lose your audience along the way. And while there were a huge number of time-travel nuances in the closing scenes, I wager most people missed at least half of them.Perhaps I'm a bit of an elitist in thinking I did get them and many others didn't, but that's not exactly the way to maximize your profits making a movie."
" bloated & pretentious
",Chris_Ego,2,9 March 2023,"I have to admit crashing a real plane with practical effects was a highlight, but this doesn't make ""Tenet"" a good action movie. I'd say it's Nolands worst project since this film tries so hard to be unique it gets lost in the sands of its own time. When ""Tenet"" was released in 2020 everybody was hyped about the way how the reverse footage was shot. This is interesting but doesn't look convincing all the time. The fight at the airport is tedious and unwillingly funny, especially when the SWAT like guys are crawling backwards on the floor making funny shoe noises like they played basketball on the school court. The first hour goes by fast and so much happens in this time yet little I did understand. They keep talking too much too fast and Blondie is whispering when she is the one spreading important clues. Nolan fails to star the ""Protagonist"" in a likeable way and therefor the film just presses on without any connection to the lead. Robert Pattinson did a nice job as his sidekick Neil and I am so looking forward to see him starring the ""Batman"". Oops, I lost it there. Yeah, Tenet is a waste of your precious watching time."
" Tall Drink of Water
",sure_man,4,8 March 2023,"Although this was victimized by COVID, even after an impressive pre-release marketing campaign, the film is just not that good. A classic B-movie with an A-level budget, frenetic (bordering on incoherent) editing and a silly spin on searching for horcruxes (reference intended), the moebius strip time spin just didn't really work. Maybe the bonding agents are on the editing room floor somewhere, but I'm sure the book not based on the movie is much for fulfilling and illuminates the internal workings of the characters beyond ""save my child"" and ""I hate life so I'm taking everyone with me"". This is comic book level stuff for a work alleging to be of substance. The character motivations are ridiculously thin and cliched. Much of the monotone dialogue lacks punch and vitality. For all the pretension, this is nothing more than smoke and mirrors."
" A Mind-Bending and Spectacular Spy Thriller
",FilmFanatic2023,8,4 March 2023,"Tenet is a sci-fi action film directed by Christopher Nolan that revolves around a secret agent who uses time inversion to prevent a global catastrophe. The film is a dazzling display of Nolan's signature style, featuring stunning visuals, complex plot twists, and thrilling action sequences. The film also explores themes of free will, fate, and entropy. John David Washington leads the cast as the Protagonist, a charismatic and skilled spy who teams up with Neil (Robert Pattinson), a mysterious ally. Kenneth Branagh plays Andrei Sator, a ruthless Russian oligarch who seeks to destroy the world.I enjoyed Tenet for its ambitious and original concept, its impressive cinematography, its exhilarating pace, and its clever dialogue. I think Christopher Nolan delivered another masterpiece that challenges and entertains the audience. I would recommend Tenet to fans of sci-fi who appreciate a fast-paced and intricate film that requires multiple viewings to fully understand."
" Another masterpiece crafted by the one and only Christopher Nolan
",Nicholas_HY,10,20 February 2023,"My only regret was not watching this in the theatres. Well, streaming this has its own advantages like you can rewind and watch the specific scene's ""before and after."" I find that most of the bad reviews talk about the plot and while I agree that the plot will be confusing for a majority of the people but once you get a grasp of it you will awe and appreciate this even more. Even the soundtrack was just perfect for this movie, I'm actually glad that Nolan didn't use Zimmer for this project because his style wasn't suitable. While the action sequences are decent, I'd recommend this movie for its story and plot because I myself enjoys a good intricate mystery/thriller stuffs. Nolan is truly one of the best of our time."
" Another amazing film by Christopher Nolan
",Reviewosaurus,9,19 February 2023,"After a near-death experience during a CIA operation, the Protagonist is recruited to join a government organization called Tenet, tasked with preventing World World III. The time inversion aspect of the film was so interesting and different; I've never seen anything like it in another film. You will probably be confused throughout the movie, but by the end, everything comes together. I like how the characters were portrayed and written, but one thing I felt this movie was lacking was a solid antagonist. I love this film, it's mind-blowing, gripping, and thought-provoking, and I would highly recommend it."
" Worth to watch
",giedriavas,8,17 February 2023,"A film will discover both fans and those who will enjoy less. Nolan is trying to apply the ideas we saw in his previous fantastic films,but also discovered something new - what is worth seeing in cinema and seeing more than once at home. Without telling the story of the film,one can only ask questions - what if onr way or another ? So the film is kind of divided into two parts. It is necessary and possible to watch from the very first minutes and you will get into the story perfectly. Fun to see know or lesser known actors ,becouse in the movie a lot of action,well that charisma was even more. After movie the music track was not known to me,but when i heard it in cinema after movie..damn... the whirlwinds were walking for generations."
" A movie that bit more than it could chew
",dargosmunteanu,8,17 February 2023,"The concept behind Tenet is a very interesting one, but also very difficult to implement in a movie and probably even more important, vaguely explained and expanded upon throughout the runtime. That last bit is probably its downfall, stated rules that govern its function aren't consistently abided by, making the whole adventure sketchy at best.Acting was good, action scenes were interesting, the story could've been solid if the whole time-traveling mechanic would've been treated in a more traditional manner.It may not have ended up being a high concept sci-fi movie, but it would've been a more consistent and, overall, ejoyable long (yeah, a bit too long, maybe?) cinematic experience.Worth the watch, but it may require of you to fill in a lot of blanks that the writers and technology left within it."
" Phantasy of a genius director but a plain movie
",furkankilickap,8,14 February 2023,"Christopher Nolan's filmography has, in my view, a registered position in the history of cinema; however, with this movie Nolan cannot carry himself further when we compare Tenet with his former works, most of which had box office-recorded movies.There is an unique idea about ""time inverting"" but the idea is not fit on the action based story which has full of cliches. Concept of inverting can be easy to understand from the perspective of Nolan undoubtedly, but I'm sure that audience may have difficulty to understand the idea scene by scene upon the actions of the characters or from the story because action genre has fast-paced storytelling; nonetheless, you can get the idea and what Nolan is trying to say in general. So I agree with some critics saying that Nolan made this movie just for himself.Besides, background of the characters are empty unfortunately. You cannot feel empathy for the protagonist or cannot understand the motivation of some characters to a certain extent but performances of actresses & actors quite well - especially John David Washington.From cinematographic and musical perspectives, the movie makes real the atmosphere and the world. For the last five years Hoyte Van Hoytema (DP) and Ludwig Göransson (composer) have the names proved themselves in their professions, and they deserve some credits specifically for this movie.Although Tenet has full of bad criticism according to a stereotypical action based movie, you can feel the magical and dazzling touch of a master director with an idea that wasn't thought before. Therefore, the movie deserves to be watched & a score above average.TRIVIA: Contains no green screens, just practical effects. This includes the inversion sequences, for which director Christopher Nolan chose instead to shoot each scene twice: one time moving forward, and once with the actors doing everything backward. (BIND BLOWING DIRECTING 101)"
" Loud and impenetrable
",Quinoa_Chris_Kirk,1,8 February 2023,"A man on an international mission to save the world from the deadliest weapon of all, the future.Two moods: excessive incomprehensible exposition and LOUD incomprehensible action sequences. At no point do you know what is going on, nor are you given any reason to care. It is at all times tedious, meaningless and irritating. None of the characters are remotely interesting, much of the dialogue is inaudible and the ridiculous convolutions add up to nothing. And this cost over $200 million to make.Here Nolan has retreated deeply, unpleasantly and unforgivably into his own idiosyncrasy and left his loyal audience scrambling to come up with excuses for him."
" Didn't finish watching it !!!
",jayydee3,5,5 February 2023,"The main actor is not great. Mumbles his words, his appearance doesn't fit in with the people he is dealing with and no class. Not a James Bond type at all. The story was confusing and and far too long to keep your attention. Not exciting and certainly not believable as far as the main actor went. I think it had the makings of a very good file if the casting had been different in the main roles. This turned out to be just a mess. I got to the point that I just couldn't watch it any further and turned it off. Could have been much better with some more experienced actors and
a better script. All in all very poorly done movie."
" Too clever for its own good - just as another reviewer said
",kambomambos,2,5 February 2023,"Had potential but way too complicated. Had to watch with subtitles and continuously rewind to work out what was going on - even then we were unclear. If it was simplified a little and the dialogue made clearer (in every way) it would have been much more enjoyable. Put aside an extra hour for stopping and rewinding if you're gonna watch this one.Well acted and characters were solid but if you can't hear what they are saying, particularly when they are talking non-sensical physics and time travel it's very difficult to follow. Good cast, great effects but without clarity it's unfortunately a frustrating waste of three hours."
" basic premise is stupid
",cleeds-27588,1,31 January 2023,"The basic premise is that a scientist in the future invents time reversing devices, regrets her invention as too dangerous, so instead of destroying it she decides to send them back in time to out present, where a mad Russian oligarch somehow discovers all this and decides to use the invention to destroy the present world because we are destroying the environment - quite how or why he thought this would work is never mentioned, because it is too ridiculous. That, or we just have to accept that he is mad, or the future people told him it was the only way. He does it because he is dying and his madness makes him think if he can't live then no one else can either - or something. It is not clear which, so pick'n'mix as you like. Time travel movies never work. Never. Basically it's an excuse for a lot of Bond style fist fights, explosions, crashes, car chases, random violence. As with Bond, the baddie has an unending supply of incredibly gullible and stupid helpers all over the world who are quite happy to be killed and maimed on his behalf, and set off these devices on command from the baddie as he lounges on his mega-yacht. Just terrible."
" In a few words, a waste of time...
",jesusroblesazul,5,31 January 2023,"Well, I could suffer much more with this absurd movie, but i was enough wise to avoid the suffering. Why people try to understand garbage like this? When at a first sight you can see the final result: a protagonist without personality, scenes plenty of unnecessary violence, excess of special effects, and at last an clumsy attempt to make up the mediocrity of the film using some well known actors with no results. I can accept mister Nolan isa very distinguished director. In fact, I enjoy very much most oh his work, but this time, what Can I say: this work is a failure in many ways, a very boring movie in despite of all the action the director adds at any moment. Anyway, a waste of time..."
" My head hurts
",benpulford-82589,10,29 January 2023,"I've watched many great films that the more I watch, the more I understand the plot. But, with this film, the less I understand it!!! Why? Why? Why? How the heck did Meister Nolan get this past the producers? Not that I'm complaining. It truly is a great, great film. It's just...that it defies all logic. Is Christopher Nolan from the future? I was intrigued to note there is a reference to Oppenheimer in the film and as we no know Nolan is making / has been making a bio-pic about Oppenheimer. Or is that statement a spolier? Is a spolier a spolier if it's written in the future about the past? Or is it - is a spolier a spolier if it's written in the past about the future? My head hurts...for all the right reasons. Very much looking forward to Oppenheimer!"
" For all its ambition, 'Tenet' is a mushy glob of nonsense.
",punch_p,3,29 January 2023,"This summer, in anticipation of the release of Tenet, I wrote a piece defending the position of Christopher Nolan as not merely a filmmaker of huge commercial clout, but as someone whose quality of work on an artistic, cinematographic, and emotional (yes, I wrote that!) level merits proper appreciation too. I did post a warning though that Nolan's increasing reverence for tech and his control freak tendencies were threatening to outweigh that lovely dichotomy he had always been able to blend between all things genre and his metaphysically-inflected narratives.With Tenet, Nolan totally oversteps that line and has turned in a work that runs dangerously close to self-satire. While I would argue his previous ten films have always possessed some portion of an emotional edge amid the viscerality of their storytelling, Tenet is, simply, a spectatorial dead weight. It is completely lacking in tension and is just a film endlessly stuck in the cycle of explaining and justifying itself and its conceit (perhaps an unintended, ironic echo of its central theme of inversion). Copious exposition is nothing new to a Nolan film, but comprehensiblity and an emotional core always co-existed with that philosophical bent. Even Memento - a film which loosely echoes the tricks of Tenet with a focus on a narrative being played in reverse - was able to conjure three-dimensional character arcs out of those thematics. In Tenet, however, the characters remain (unintentionally) flat, which is borne out when the Protagonist's climactic conversation with Neil and his one last look at Kat don't carry the dramatic pay-off Nolan is clearly angling for.Even in Nolan's lesser guise as a purveyor of spectacle, Tenet falls flat. For all the lustre, gravitas and awe Nolan applies to his action sequences (I'm thinking about the exploding jumbo, the billionaire's yacht, the racing boats), he's unable to aestheticise these for his audience the way his idol, Michael Mann, can. It's because Mann's action scenes are always connected to the ethics and emotion of his stories, whereas Nolan's function as extraneous gorging on extreme financial, technological and industrial might."
" Whoa...if you thought 'Inception' was mind-blowing...just wait!
",cochrandarin,8,29 January 2023,"Ok, I had to watch Inception about 3 times to, uh, get it. You'll have to watch this one about five. The concept is mind-blowing with the whole inversion of time and reversed entropy through the continium, or...something like that. Basically, folks in the future have figured out how to send something traveling backwards through time. So, future bullets that have already been fired are sent spiraling backwards and end up back in the magazine of the gun someone is holding before they've even fired it. If that sounds complicated, just wait till cars and humans start going backwards. The complex part is when they all start meeting themselves and the plot folds and unfolds...is revisited...is changed...is observed by their other selves just across the battlefield...etc. Etc. Etc...you get the picture. All the while, our hero (who is not named and is just referred to as the 'Protagonist') is trying to thwart this dangerous technology, which has obviously ended up in the wrong hands, from destroying the world. Not by sending a nuke back into the hands of Hitler and the SS, but even worse; Using some kinda complicated math algorithm to create a doomsday bomb. Or at least I THINK that's what he was doing. I tried to tell my 9th grade Calculus teacher that not only was math useless, turns out IT's DANGEROUS!!Anyhow, the acting is great. The lead guy does good. Robert Pattinson from Twilight fame, is the lead character's, uh...side-kick and he does just fine. Elizabeth Dibicki does great as the...well, it's complicated. You'll just have to watch and figure it out for yourself. The truth is, you could say that about most of this movie. The plot is so complex and quick-moving that we found ourselves rewinding many times to review a line here and there that was important to what was going on. I think I'm a fairly smart guy, I have a doctorate and even an undergrad bachelor of science degree. I have even written a sci-fi book, so I thought I would 'get it' maybe a little better than the average fella walking through Walmart that works as an auto mechanic (no offense to that line of work) but even I felt myself raising an eyebrow many times while watching this movie. It's so confusing at times that I even asked my bunch; ""How many average folks would have turned this off by now?""It's not to say that it isn't entertaining. It's definitely original and the special effects are beyond mind-blowing and it redefines the phrase ""plot twists""!So, give it a try and be prepared to plan on watching again, and maybe again. Grab a plate of chocolate chip cookies and pull up a sofa by the fire on a weekend night with the fam when you got nothing stressful on your mind to distract you. You'll definitely need a clear head to try and navigate through this one.Enjoy...."
" Nolan really wants us to believe he is a genius
",LawrenceLambleg,5,29 January 2023,"I'm honestly baffled how could a director with an incredible debut like Memento go so far down his own rabbit holes.Plot - pretty original and very cool concepts, but so poorly executed. Whatever works in this movie is quickly ruined by exposition.Pacing - too much action, too much dialogue you keep missing because of loud music and too much noise. They tried to cram so much stuff in two and a half hours and this movie could easily do without half of its content.Dialogue - there are no characters in this movie. The only purpose of every character is to tell you where the plot is going, just in case you were too stupid to figure it out. So there's no dialogue really. Just Nolan holding the viewer's hand through this mess of a movie through different characters. So when the characters speak to each other, it feels like you're watching the director's commentary rather than an actual movie.Acting - both Pattinson and Michael Caine are wasted here. Washington doesn't have a character. His character doesn't even have a name, he is called ""The Protagonist"" and the big plot twist of this movie is that he IS in fact THE PROTAGONIST. Bravo, Nolan! Kenneth Brannagh plays every Russian villain you've ever seen in campy 80s and 90s action movies. He is the worst thing about this movie in my opinion. If they hired someone better to play Sator, I would've at least had some motivation to sit through the movie. It's not most of the actors' fault that they don't have actual characters to work with, but Kenneth Brannagh really screws this up.The ol' switcheroo of continuity - the entire second half of this movie is just one big continuity error. This is probably the most unforgivable crime that this movie commits. Nolan seems to just switch the reversal of time on and off to make this contrived plot work. You see the entire world supposedly go into reverse, but all of the characters are moving forwards in time so you can follow the actual plot, even the ones that aren't ""inverted"". If they really committed to the time reversal, it would've been beautiful, but no... characters keep ""inverting"" themselves for the sake of comprehensive storytelling. You watch the movie, then you get confused by something that doesn't make sense and a character appears not a second later to tell you ""ah, you see... I inverted myself back then... so now I'm dead, but actually I was dead..."" Yeah, sure... You really wanna blow us away, Nolan? Don't do a half-assed attempt at time-reversal where everybody talks and walks normal. Make the second half actually reversed... It would've been way better to be confusing, rather than just pretending to be clever. The movie explicitly tells you ""don't try to understand it"" and then feels the need to keep explaining itself to you for two hours... In its best moments this movie had no exposition. If Nolan lets things just happen without any pointless explanation, I think his movies would've been way better than they are."
" It's different
",thisisstepercival,6,27 January 2023,"Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly a great filmmaker, although personally I find his films very hit and miss - The Dark Knight is outstanding and even played as a straight cops and robbers movie instead of a superhero film that still stands. Likewise with The Prestige, another simply perfect film. On the flip side of that he gives us say, Dunkirk which for me was more than disappointing. Anyway, Tenet falls smack back in the middle. It's not a masterclass in filmmaking nor is it disappointing. It looks incredible and it's action packed and full of the trucks you'd expect from a Nolan film. However, it's just too convoluted and hard to follow. It's a bit too clever for its own good which sometimes can be a good thing but to most casual viewers it's just not worth the effort. I have watched it 3 times now and I admit it gets better with each viewing but you probably shouldn't need to watch something half a dozen times to fully grasp the story or what's going on. If you struggled with Inception then seriously give Tenet a miss it'll just leave you with a headache. If you want to watch it to be dazzled by jaw dropping set pieces then give it a go. It's not a bad film it just pushes filmmaking to new limits which isn't a bad thing.On a footnote it would be interesting to see what Nolan could do if he was given the opportunity to helm a Bond movie because there's possibly no-one better at action sequences around right now."
" Great idea - told mediocre
",spam-778-616598,6,26 January 2023,"The idea is great, the plot points should work for most people - but it's told in a too confusing way. And I love complex stories! This just wasn't written very well. The special effects were great, of course, but the heroes goal was missing and the reason why we should care for him. It was all too confusing - I couldn't remember the characters or their stories, I didn't get most of the connections ... and that's coming from someone who loved a truly complex story like Dark. What looked extremely promising, turned out quite boring - my husband fell asleep at the end, because he couldn't follow anyway anymore. I say it's worth a watch - because the idea was great after all."
" The thing on which the movie is built
",Zeyders,7,25 January 2023,"Christopher Nolan's films always delight with their ideas, the quality of the films, and this film is no exception. But the film has its pluses and minuses in every moment.The main thing on which the film is built is made qualitatively and difficult, but the explanation of this chip lasts almost the entire film. The whole main plot is built on this concept, which can't be called a minus, but also can't be a plus. The characters are not revealed, but the main characters are memorable. The special effects, the only thing, remain unqualified because Nolan prefers to recreate them live.It's a good movie to watch. Interesting action, a concept that you see for the first time in movies exactly like this."
" Complex or complicated?
",tpvmpdbm,6,24 January 2023,"Tenet really wants to be a complex movie which feels like something you can not understand. And this kind of overwhelming story works. But to be honest it doesn't work to me.It's not really complex...you just can't understand what is going on because the scenes are switching so fast, you are always busy to follow it.At least the characters are not overwhelming. But in favor they are boring. You can not feel with them or see any progress they are going threw. They are just random characters who you will forget if you are rewatching tenet in the future.But also it is really interesting to watch and challenging your mind. Can you follow the story the first time you are watching tenet? Maybe yes or maybe not. It doesn't matter because it is not a movie you should understand and this is what makes it complicated and not complex...even if tenet wants to be complicated. After the first time you haved watched tenet there is nothing you can think about and just your aha-moment of understanding what the heck was going on the last two hours."
" It requires a lot of complex aches
",dr_hgj-48231,10,22 January 2023,"C Nolan must be clapped as his team gave yet another complex scientific but confusing mixtures of all possible twist n turn exploring reversible time machine, reversing even physical, chemical, emotional,, all.... nal and....... cal limits crossed in confusing the film watcher. Has taken every possible filmy imaginary summersaults ways of impossibilities.... Giving current focus of Uranium, relationships, interest what next alive, fights, stunts, modern gazzets, reversible bullets weapons, every thing except human grid negativity kept growing!!!! Has mixed the current affairs, event reference, good acting, Music back ground sound effact, mono chrome color code to very high level. His reputation is built on still keeping Interest alive! Many youtubbers explaining the movie will flourish and will surely have newer verdict... I rate 10 so as not to do injustice to any section. It is mental excercise."
" A feast of vision and thought
",s-19392,8,22 January 2023,"I am a loyal fan of director Nolan. I have watched and enjoyed every film of his without exception. I think he is the director who really understands the art of film. For this film, I call it the feast of vision because I am really affected by every shot of it. Every shot, every picture, and every frame are individually captured as a work of art. In terms of the overall picture environment, this is the only work I feel comfortable with. In other words, I want you to watch it again. This is a very difficult thing for a science fiction film, And the director did it, which really made me very happy. The above is my feeling from the perspective of direct sense. Next, let's talk about the plot. As usual, I don't talk about the details. I admit that I may be a little stupid. When I saw the film for the first time, I didn't see the specific content of the story. The specific story is really a little complicated, but one thing is worth affirming. Although the story is complex and difficult, But there are no films with complex plots, which annoy the audience. After seeing them, they will never watch them for the second time. But this film is different. After watching it for the first time, you can't understand it. You will be eager to see it for the second time and the third time until you understand it. It is like a strong magnetic magnet, which has always attracted you to explore it. I especially admire the director's thinking ability. I have seen AI before, It was the first time I was attracted by him. After so long and watching so many films, I am very honest to tell you that he has not changed. This film also provided me with great inspiration in the creative process. The expression of ""transformation"" and the very artistic treatment also provided me with a lot of good help."
