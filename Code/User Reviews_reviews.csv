" Disappointing
",lbrownfi92,4,26 April 2023,"I don't get it, and I'm not talking about the mechanics of the movie here. I understand that. What I don't get is why people like this film so much. It's not a particularly unique story, the acting isn't good, and the plot feels weak.First, the story isn't unique. Sure, it plays a bit with time moving in both directions simultaneously rather than a Back-to-the-Future-type of linear time travel. But still. It doesn't feel like a fresh idea.The acting is frankly lackluster. I don't particularly like the Protagonist (John David Washington), nor the Antagonist (Kenneth Branagh, who I know for a fact is capable of more). The only good performances in the film come from Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki, but they're both underutilized in favor of focus on the Protagonist.The plot needs more support. I wouldn't say that it has holes, because I think that's fairly well covered, and that's something the film does well. But it seems like an afterthought (spoiler) to explain the true nature of the ""plutonium"" halfway through. Certain characters get virtually no development and are very one-dimensional. There are no real overarching themes - no critique of society or humanity, really nothing deeper than what you see on screen.Overall, a disappointment, especially given the overwhelmingly positive reviews it received. I wish it had been better."
" 100mph and going nowhere
",cmmccready,3,22 April 2023,"Chaotic and confusing right from the start.The main character is caught by Russians at the start but what were they actually doing in the operah house?Very hard to follow what is going on, very complicated fictional science going on that they take no time to properly explain and the end fight scene, the bad guys are fighting the good guys because they all want the whole world to end, including themselves? Hard to believe.The main characters love interest is just so hard to believe, there is zero chemistry between them.One of the worst movies I have ever watched and I normally love Nolan films."
" Time confused
",egorrukas,7,16 April 2023,"""Tenet"" is a science-fiction action thriller film directed by Christopher Nolan, who is known for his visually stunning and complex films. The movie follows a protagonist (John David Washington) as he tries to prevent a global catastrophe caused by the inversion of time.The film's opening scene immediately sets the tone for the rest of the movie, with an intense and visually stunning sequence of a terrorist attack in a packed opera house. The scene showcases the film's impressive production design and use of practical effects, which is a hallmark of Nolan's films.As the film progresses, the audience is introduced to the concept of inversion, which is the ability to reverse the flow of time. This concept is both fascinating and confusing, and it takes a while to fully grasp. The film does a decent job of explaining the rules of inversion, but there are still moments where it feels a bit convoluted.The protagonist, who is only referred to as ""The Protagonist,"" is a skilled CIA operative who is recruited by a secret organization called Tenet to stop a Russian oligarch (Kenneth Branagh) from causing a global catastrophe. Washington's performance is excellent, and he is able to convey the necessary gravitas and intensity needed for the role.The supporting cast is also impressive, with Robert Pattinson playing a mysterious and charming operative, Elizabeth Debicki as the estranged wife of the villain, and Branagh as the menacing antagonist. However, the characters are not given a lot of depth, and the audience is never fully invested in their individual journeys.The action scenes in the film are spectacular, with Nolan's signature use of practical effects and practical stunts. The use of inversion adds a unique twist to the action sequences, with characters fighting and driving in reverse. The film's climax, which takes place in an abandoned city, is a visual spectacle and a true testament to Nolan's ability to create stunning set pieces.However, the film's pacing is a bit uneven, with some scenes feeling too long and others feeling rushed. The film's editing, while impressive at times, also contributes to the confusion caused by the inversion concept. There are moments where it feels like the film is trying to be too clever for its own good, and the narrative suffers as a result."
" Good story, bad acting.
",fadiobaji-26542,8,15 April 2023,"I agree with some reviews that you have to know some physics (quantum physics) to begin to understand what's going on, but I think the movie has a solid story.HOWEVER the acting of non-star actors are just very very bad! I don't know how they missed that!For example when they attack the people inside the plane, they just go to sleep in less than a second! He barely touches the person! Also without any resistance! That's laughable!Also when attacking the driver inside the truck, he just go to sleep like instantly! WTF c'mon seriously?!Other than it's a good movie with very hard to understand logic for most people. But I enjoyed it."
" Tenet - A Mind-Bending Action Spectacle
",LisaJones_1,9,14 April 2023,"If you're a fan of Christopher Nolan's work, you won't be disappointed by his latest film, Tenet. This action-packed sci-fi thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The movie is visually stunning, with mind-bending action sequences that will leave you speechless. The soundtrack, composed by Ludwig Göransson, is perfectly fitting for the movie's intense and suspenseful moments.John David Washington and Robert Pattinson have excellent chemistry as the movie's leads. Their performances are nothing short of phenomenal. Elizabeth Debicki and Kenneth Branagh also deliver standout performances.One of the most impressive aspects of the movie is the way it plays with time. Without giving anything away, the concept of inversion is both fascinating and confusing, and it's implemented flawlessly.Overall, Tenet is a must-see movie for anyone who loves action, sci-fi, or mind-bending thrillers. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth watching on the big screen.Quote: ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it."" - Neil (Robert Pattinson)"
" Good movie, bad plot
",McDiarmid23,6,13 April 2023,"When I watched Tenet I was really excited at first because you are immediately thrown into the plot and have no idea, but from time to time you understand the story. However, after some time I got bored because there was not so much tension as in other spy and heist movies. I loved to see Kenneth Branagh in this playing the villain, but other actors played their role not as good as I wished they would. I have to say that the plot is very boring after some time and then it feels like you're wasting your time when you watch more of it. I watched the whole movie but I had the same feeling. To sum it up: Boring plot, good shots, Bad acting, bad dialogues, and you cannot really understand the story."
" Convoluted mess
",donegalcat,5,8 April 2023,"Tenet too often feels like an overly long gimmick because the film lacks the plot, the characters or the acting to hold the attention otherwise. The film shows technical accomplishment in depicting action in reverse but that is about it.The plot is a convoluted mess and long before the end I lost interest in trying to follow it.There may be multiple timelines and versions of the characters, but the film doesn't make them interesting enough to care. John David Washington in the lead role lacks charisma and isn't strong enough to carry the film. Branagh's accent is all over the place as the weak Russian villain. Pattinson does better as the stereotypical shady fixer while Debicki is solid as the damsel in distress.Going into this I was hoping for something along the lines of Inception but instead Tenet just continues the long decline from Christopher Nolan since that 2010 hit."
" I wonder if the actors in this understood the plot?
",andrew-huggett,1,7 April 2023,Tried to watch this - gave up on it about an hour from the end. What a mess! There are a couple of moderately exciting set pieces but the narrative structure of this film went over my head. I feel it's trying too hard to be clever and really it's probably quite a simple story. It wasn't helped by the music which was very loud drowning out the dialog. Very disappointing. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on the 4K disc - at least it was cheap. I might give it another go at some future point. I wasn't even all that impressed with the picture quality - it didn't look much better than a standard blu-ray. The opening sequence was completely incomprehensible and didn't seem to have any relevance to the rest of the film. I wonder if the actors in this film knew what was going on plot wise?
" Needs Repeat Viewing to Enjoy, but there's a downside.
",Jimmy_The_Jacobite,8,26 March 2023,"Nolan has quite the brain creating science fiction, but this complex idea is one of the few that translated to have a fair understanding. Very interesting perspective preventing nuclear holocaust with the introduction of time travel as the core to its story. Visually its memorable, but needs repeat viewing to have understanding of rules why the story plays out the way it does. The unfortunate part of this film, John Washington isn't convincing as the lead. His persona is forced, lacks charisma & becomes less believable of a character that is capable as such for the story. Patterson is surprisingly good. This film is extremely complex in story, needs time to put together."
" Decided not to waste anymore of my time
",sleepingsunrise,5,25 March 2023,"I really wanted to like this movie. I became interested in it because of Robert Pattinson and it being directed by Nolan.I typically give movies 30 minutes to impress me because I HATE wasting my time. I tried watching this one twice and ultimately gave up about an hour into it. An hour is generous for me. I gave it that much because I know many of Nolan's films are a slow burn and worth the wait.The concept makes no sense and they don't even bother trying to make it make sense. They even tell you ""Don't try to understand it"". Yeah, I won't.The action and dialogue was too quick to keep up. It basically looked like watching a movie on rewind.Ultimately the reason why I turned it off was because I got tired of watching the wife be terrorized by the ex-husband. It was sickening.If only I could go back in time and not watch this movie."
" It's amazing and it drives you crazy
",ahmedyo,8,23 March 2023,"Christopher Nolan is a crazy and insane person. There is no dispute about this. What Nolan is trying to convey to the viewers is an adventure that is difficult to imagine on your own. It is also difficult to imagine its events and facts. It is also difficult to photograph many moments. Fear that my mind will be distracted by this wonderful drama.The story of the film is about the attempt of some people to stop the end of the world. This person is known in this film as the Protagonist, as he does not know anything about the mission or how to end the world except for one word, which is Tenet, and the meaning of this word will appear through the events of the film, but frankly, the aesthetic of talking about this film lies In penetrating the events and talking comfortably about the events of the movie.The photography was aesthetic with things that neither the mind nor the eye could have expected while you were sitting in front of the screen. The photographic ability in this film exceeded many stages and reached a stage of dazzling. It exceeded the choice of angles or even the duration of the shot. We have different dimensions and a new method in how to photograph.The aesthetic of the story is not in asking ourselves what the story is. The aesthetic of the story is in how the story is told and explained. The narrative of the story and the photographic capabilities greatly exceeded the events of the story and anything else in the film, where scientific and physical facts and theories were used that greatly assist in storytelling. They greatly help in explaining the events and how they pass. Events and these scientific theories and physical facts that boggle your mind and drive you crazy have made my eyes stop closing while my time to sleep came."
" Imperfect, Complex, Multiple Viewings Required
",blakechesledon,8,19 March 2023,"Huge Nolan fan here. I would say that Interstellar is not only my favorite movie but in my opinion the single best movie I have ever seen.Tenet is not as good as Interstellar. I respect Nolan for how much he expects of his audience; he wants the people who watch his films to pay close attention to every detail. My problem with that, at least with Tenet, is that even when you watch with subtitles (which is necessary considering how dense some of the dialogue is and how difficult it is to hear at times) AND when you are intently paying attention you can still be completely lost. There are several sequences where if you miss a single line of dialogue, you will have no idea what or why the characters are doing what they are doing in the next scene. I am not a dumb person, but this movie requires several viewings to even hope to understand. I think that is primarily where this movie's faults lie; viewers are punished for even a momentary lapse of attention. I am not a fan of expository dialogue as a general rule, but this movie could have used a few more scenes that explained what was going on.A movie requiring at least two or three viewings can be off-putting to some, and understandably so. But if you do give this movie a couple of chances, it will reward you. Some truly epic, mind-bending action sequences with characters moving forward and backward in time simultaneously. These scenes become more epic once you grasp the idea of inversion. An original plot (relatively, it is essentially a spy movie), and once you have seen it a few times it feels pretty cool to ""get it."" Several orders of magnitude more difficult to follow than Inception, and not quite as good, but still a very good modern action film that isn't about superheroes."
" Not for all, but for some
",ZinedineElbaroni,8,13 March 2023,"Tenet is a cinematic masterpiece that takes you on an exciting and surprising journey through time and space. From the first scene you are immersed in a world of intrigue and danger that keeps you in suspense throughout the film. Be told. The action sequences are really good, and the visual effects are great.The cast is phenomenal, with John David Washington giving an outstanding performance in the lead role. Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki also excel in their respective roles, bringing depth and nuance to their characters.But what sets Tenet apart is his sheer ambition. This is a movie that demands your full attention and rewards you for it. Challenge.In short, Tenet is a love letter to cinema, an exhilarating ride that pushes the boundaries of what is possible on screen. If you're looking for a breathtaking film that keeps you pondering its mysteries long after the credits roll, look no further than Tenet."
" Damned good try
",xyqkp,7,10 March 2023,"Putting aside the ham-handed effort to explain the physics, which was unavoidable since it's clear no physicist was ever asked to look at the plausibility of the script, the overall premise wasn't awful. The first 30-45 minutes quite muddled the premise by trying to create suspense where there was no need for any yet; choosing to open with a James Bond spy ambience was the wrong choice. And, oddly, in the end the very premise itself completely eliminated any suspense in the ending (because, we knew the world wasn't going to be deleted, so we knew almost to the smallest detail what was going to happen). That's not really a failure on this movie's fault; such circuitous and ""destiny"" oriented premises always run that risk. With such premises you need to look for suspense in some fashion other than the question of whether destiny is real or not. The ""destroy everything or nothing"" premise could not be the key suspense point. If, for example, they'd focused the critical ending question of where the protagonist and the girl would get together, they'd have posed a question that could go either way ... and therefore been suspenseful. I've only ever seen one ""end of the world"" movie where focus successfully stayed on whether the world would end or not ... and surprisingly, it did ... and then more surprisingly, it didn't.Clearly a WHOLE lot of effort was put into thinking through the visual implications of forward/backward time travel. Some very inventive chase and fight scenes, and especially seeing the same sequences played out first in forward time and then again later in reverse time. A huge scripting effort and an even greater, monumental continuity effort. Unfortunately, as one might expect for a task this large and complex, there were quite a few perspective failures. But, perhaps, the greatest failure was in audio. Faces covered in masks (perhaps a bit stupid overkill-one asks why air needed to be reversed when literally nothing else in the forward world needed to be) are fine visualizations, but in a movie this fast paced, all I can say is I'm damned glad I streamed it so I could go back over and over again: in a theater, mumbled clues to a complex story like this is the same thing as not bother to explain anything. People can't concentrate the necessary effort for two hours on hearing, listening, and understanding without getting migraines. The movie was clearly not shown to anyone not already familiar with the premise before editing was complete. The movie would gone up 2 ratings on IMDB if people had actually heard and understood the details of the premise and its implications, but alas far too many reviews were posted here by people who either couldn't spend the effort to understand or wouldn't.Any time you combine a frenzied presentation with a complex premise like time travel with no meaningful opportunity to pause and think, you're just going to lose your audience along the way. And while there were a huge number of time-travel nuances in the closing scenes, I wager most people missed at least half of them.Perhaps I'm a bit of an elitist in thinking I did get them and many others didn't, but that's not exactly the way to maximize your profits making a movie."
" bloated & pretentious
",Chris_Ego,2,9 March 2023,"I have to admit crashing a real plane with practical effects was a highlight, but this doesn't make ""Tenet"" a good action movie. I'd say it's Nolands worst project since this film tries so hard to be unique it gets lost in the sands of its own time. When ""Tenet"" was released in 2020 everybody was hyped about the way how the reverse footage was shot. This is interesting but doesn't look convincing all the time. The fight at the airport is tedious and unwillingly funny, especially when the SWAT like guys are crawling backwards on the floor making funny shoe noises like they played basketball on the school court. The first hour goes by fast and so much happens in this time yet little I did understand. They keep talking too much too fast and Blondie is whispering when she is the one spreading important clues. Nolan fails to star the ""Protagonist"" in a likeable way and therefor the film just presses on without any connection to the lead. Robert Pattinson did a nice job as his sidekick Neil and I am so looking forward to see him starring the ""Batman"". Oops, I lost it there. Yeah, Tenet is a waste of your precious watching time."
" Tall Drink of Water
",sure_man,4,8 March 2023,"Although this was victimized by COVID, even after an impressive pre-release marketing campaign, the film is just not that good. A classic B-movie with an A-level budget, frenetic (bordering on incoherent) editing and a silly spin on searching for horcruxes (reference intended), the moebius strip time spin just didn't really work. Maybe the bonding agents are on the editing room floor somewhere, but I'm sure the book not based on the movie is much for fulfilling and illuminates the internal workings of the characters beyond ""save my child"" and ""I hate life so I'm taking everyone with me"". This is comic book level stuff for a work alleging to be of substance. The character motivations are ridiculously thin and cliched. Much of the monotone dialogue lacks punch and vitality. For all the pretension, this is nothing more than smoke and mirrors."
" A Mind-Bending and Spectacular Spy Thriller
",FilmFanatic2023,8,4 March 2023,"Tenet is a sci-fi action film directed by Christopher Nolan that revolves around a secret agent who uses time inversion to prevent a global catastrophe. The film is a dazzling display of Nolan's signature style, featuring stunning visuals, complex plot twists, and thrilling action sequences. The film also explores themes of free will, fate, and entropy. John David Washington leads the cast as the Protagonist, a charismatic and skilled spy who teams up with Neil (Robert Pattinson), a mysterious ally. Kenneth Branagh plays Andrei Sator, a ruthless Russian oligarch who seeks to destroy the world.I enjoyed Tenet for its ambitious and original concept, its impressive cinematography, its exhilarating pace, and its clever dialogue. I think Christopher Nolan delivered another masterpiece that challenges and entertains the audience. I would recommend Tenet to fans of sci-fi who appreciate a fast-paced and intricate film that requires multiple viewings to fully understand."
" Another masterpiece crafted by the one and only Christopher Nolan
",Nicholas_HY,10,20 February 2023,"My only regret was not watching this in the theatres. Well, streaming this has its own advantages like you can rewind and watch the specific scene's ""before and after."" I find that most of the bad reviews talk about the plot and while I agree that the plot will be confusing for a majority of the people but once you get a grasp of it you will awe and appreciate this even more. Even the soundtrack was just perfect for this movie, I'm actually glad that Nolan didn't use Zimmer for this project because his style wasn't suitable. While the action sequences are decent, I'd recommend this movie for its story and plot because I myself enjoys a good intricate mystery/thriller stuffs. Nolan is truly one of the best of our time."
" Another amazing film by Christopher Nolan
",Reviewosaurus,9,19 February 2023,"After a near-death experience during a CIA operation, the Protagonist is recruited to join a government organization called Tenet, tasked with preventing World World III. The time inversion aspect of the film was so interesting and different; I've never seen anything like it in another film. You will probably be confused throughout the movie, but by the end, everything comes together. I like how the characters were portrayed and written, but one thing I felt this movie was lacking was a solid antagonist. I love this film, it's mind-blowing, gripping, and thought-provoking, and I would highly recommend it."
" Worth to watch
",giedriavas,8,17 February 2023,"A film will discover both fans and those who will enjoy less. Nolan is trying to apply the ideas we saw in his previous fantastic films,but also discovered something new - what is worth seeing in cinema and seeing more than once at home. Without telling the story of the film,one can only ask questions - what if onr way or another ? So the film is kind of divided into two parts. It is necessary and possible to watch from the very first minutes and you will get into the story perfectly. Fun to see know or lesser known actors ,becouse in the movie a lot of action,well that charisma was even more. After movie the music track was not known to me,but when i heard it in cinema after movie..damn... the whirlwinds were walking for generations."
" A movie that bit more than it could chew
",dargosmunteanu,8,17 February 2023,"The concept behind Tenet is a very interesting one, but also very difficult to implement in a movie and probably even more important, vaguely explained and expanded upon throughout the runtime. That last bit is probably its downfall, stated rules that govern its function aren't consistently abided by, making the whole adventure sketchy at best.Acting was good, action scenes were interesting, the story could've been solid if the whole time-traveling mechanic would've been treated in a more traditional manner.It may not have ended up being a high concept sci-fi movie, but it would've been a more consistent and, overall, ejoyable long (yeah, a bit too long, maybe?) cinematic experience.Worth the watch, but it may require of you to fill in a lot of blanks that the writers and technology left within it."
" Phantasy of a genius director but a plain movie
",furkankilickap,8,14 February 2023,"Christopher Nolan's filmography has, in my view, a registered position in the history of cinema; however, with this movie Nolan cannot carry himself further when we compare Tenet with his former works, most of which had box office-recorded movies.There is an unique idea about ""time inverting"" but the idea is not fit on the action based story which has full of cliches. Concept of inverting can be easy to understand from the perspective of Nolan undoubtedly, but I'm sure that audience may have difficulty to understand the idea scene by scene upon the actions of the characters or from the story because action genre has fast-paced storytelling; nonetheless, you can get the idea and what Nolan is trying to say in general. So I agree with some critics saying that Nolan made this movie just for himself.Besides, background of the characters are empty unfortunately. You cannot feel empathy for the protagonist or cannot understand the motivation of some characters to a certain extent but performances of actresses & actors quite well - especially John David Washington.From cinematographic and musical perspectives, the movie makes real the atmosphere and the world. For the last five years Hoyte Van Hoytema (DP) and Ludwig Göransson (composer) have the names proved themselves in their professions, and they deserve some credits specifically for this movie.Although Tenet has full of bad criticism according to a stereotypical action based movie, you can feel the magical and dazzling touch of a master director with an idea that wasn't thought before. Therefore, the movie deserves to be watched & a score above average.TRIVIA: Contains no green screens, just practical effects. This includes the inversion sequences, for which director Christopher Nolan chose instead to shoot each scene twice: one time moving forward, and once with the actors doing everything backward. (BIND BLOWING DIRECTING 101)"
" Loud and impenetrable
",Quinoa_Chris_Kirk,1,8 February 2023,"A man on an international mission to save the world from the deadliest weapon of all, the future.Two moods: excessive incomprehensible exposition and LOUD incomprehensible action sequences. At no point do you know what is going on, nor are you given any reason to care. It is at all times tedious, meaningless and irritating. None of the characters are remotely interesting, much of the dialogue is inaudible and the ridiculous convolutions add up to nothing. And this cost over $200 million to make.Here Nolan has retreated deeply, unpleasantly and unforgivably into his own idiosyncrasy and left his loyal audience scrambling to come up with excuses for him."
" Didn't finish watching it !!!
",jayydee3,5,5 February 2023,"The main actor is not great. Mumbles his words, his appearance doesn't fit in with the people he is dealing with and no class. Not a James Bond type at all. The story was confusing and and far too long to keep your attention. Not exciting and certainly not believable as far as the main actor went. I think it had the makings of a very good file if the casting had been different in the main roles. This turned out to be just a mess. I got to the point that I just couldn't watch it any further and turned it off. Could have been much better with some more experienced actors and
a better script. All in all very poorly done movie."
" Too clever for its own good - just as another reviewer said
",kambomambos,2,5 February 2023,"Had potential but way too complicated. Had to watch with subtitles and continuously rewind to work out what was going on - even then we were unclear. If it was simplified a little and the dialogue made clearer (in every way) it would have been much more enjoyable. Put aside an extra hour for stopping and rewinding if you're gonna watch this one.Well acted and characters were solid but if you can't hear what they are saying, particularly when they are talking non-sensical physics and time travel it's very difficult to follow. Good cast, great effects but without clarity it's unfortunately a frustrating waste of three hours."
