" For teenagers and those easily fooled.
",robertclark-1,1,1 May 2023,"This film is dressed up as something profoundly ingenious and inventive, yet it is so poorly thought-through and lacking in any coherence that it is painful to watch. Rarely have I seen such a poorly directed film; each scene was awkwardly put together, poorly coordinated, and unintelligible, from the opening attack at the Kiev opera, to the nonsensical ending with soldiers running about shooting at the air like headless chickens.The acting from Washington was abysmal. Wooden and awkward, and most of the dialogue from all the cast was as spoken as if being read from the script. Even Branagh, who at least put a little energy into his sadistic and nihilistic villain, couldn't do much with such a cardboard cut-out character.The scene with Michael Caine, who even as old as Methuselah, would still out act the rest if his scene wasn't both irrelevant and hurried through, was wasted. Again, direction woeful, or was Nolan handing scenes over to assistants?A film for die-hard numpties who believe that incoherence is the sign of a master."
" One of the greatest action movies ever made
",kingreenied,10,29 April 2023,"Nolan creates his greatest movie yet, subverting every aspect of the action genre we know. He creates a metaphysical masterpiece about the state of human consciousness. This is on the same level as The Matrix and revolutionized action in the same way as that movie and Matrix: Reloaded. We are in a promising age for mind-bending action spectacle, the likes of which no one has ever seen before, and this film is proof. We see things in this movie that no other movie even comes close to matching; movements done by human-beings that are so alien to watch, it's hard to believe any of it is real. Highest praise I can give; like watching a work of art come to life."
" Disappointing
",lbrownfi92,4,26 April 2023,"I don't get it, and I'm not talking about the mechanics of the movie here. I understand that. What I don't get is why people like this film so much. It's not a particularly unique story, the acting isn't good, and the plot feels weak.First, the story isn't unique. Sure, it plays a bit with time moving in both directions simultaneously rather than a Back-to-the-Future-type of linear time travel. But still. It doesn't feel like a fresh idea.The acting is frankly lackluster. I don't particularly like the Protagonist (John David Washington), nor the Antagonist (Kenneth Branagh, who I know for a fact is capable of more). The only good performances in the film come from Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki, but they're both underutilized in favor of focus on the Protagonist.The plot needs more support. I wouldn't say that it has holes, because I think that's fairly well covered, and that's something the film does well. But it seems like an afterthought (spoiler) to explain the true nature of the ""plutonium"" halfway through. Certain characters get virtually no development and are very one-dimensional. There are no real overarching themes - no critique of society or humanity, really nothing deeper than what you see on screen.Overall, a disappointment, especially given the overwhelmingly positive reviews it received. I wish it had been better."
" 100mph and going nowhere
",cmmccready,3,22 April 2023,"Chaotic and confusing right from the start.The main character is caught by Russians at the start but what were they actually doing in the operah house?Very hard to follow what is going on, very complicated fictional science going on that they take no time to properly explain and the end fight scene, the bad guys are fighting the good guys because they all want the whole world to end, including themselves? Hard to believe.The main characters love interest is just so hard to believe, there is zero chemistry between them.One of the worst movies I have ever watched and I normally love Nolan films."
" Time confused
",egorrukas,7,16 April 2023,"""Tenet"" is a science-fiction action thriller film directed by Christopher Nolan, who is known for his visually stunning and complex films. The movie follows a protagonist (John David Washington) as he tries to prevent a global catastrophe caused by the inversion of time.The film's opening scene immediately sets the tone for the rest of the movie, with an intense and visually stunning sequence of a terrorist attack in a packed opera house. The scene showcases the film's impressive production design and use of practical effects, which is a hallmark of Nolan's films.As the film progresses, the audience is introduced to the concept of inversion, which is the ability to reverse the flow of time. This concept is both fascinating and confusing, and it takes a while to fully grasp. The film does a decent job of explaining the rules of inversion, but there are still moments where it feels a bit convoluted.The protagonist, who is only referred to as ""The Protagonist,"" is a skilled CIA operative who is recruited by a secret organization called Tenet to stop a Russian oligarch (Kenneth Branagh) from causing a global catastrophe. Washington's performance is excellent, and he is able to convey the necessary gravitas and intensity needed for the role.The supporting cast is also impressive, with Robert Pattinson playing a mysterious and charming operative, Elizabeth Debicki as the estranged wife of the villain, and Branagh as the menacing antagonist. However, the characters are not given a lot of depth, and the audience is never fully invested in their individual journeys.The action scenes in the film are spectacular, with Nolan's signature use of practical effects and practical stunts. The use of inversion adds a unique twist to the action sequences, with characters fighting and driving in reverse. The film's climax, which takes place in an abandoned city, is a visual spectacle and a true testament to Nolan's ability to create stunning set pieces.However, the film's pacing is a bit uneven, with some scenes feeling too long and others feeling rushed. The film's editing, while impressive at times, also contributes to the confusion caused by the inversion concept. There are moments where it feels like the film is trying to be too clever for its own good, and the narrative suffers as a result."
" Good story, bad acting.
",fadiobaji-26542,8,15 April 2023,"I agree with some reviews that you have to know some physics (quantum physics) to begin to understand what's going on, but I think the movie has a solid story.HOWEVER the acting of non-star actors are just very very bad! I don't know how they missed that!For example when they attack the people inside the plane, they just go to sleep in less than a second! He barely touches the person! Also without any resistance! That's laughable!Also when attacking the driver inside the truck, he just go to sleep like instantly! WTF c'mon seriously?!Other than it's a good movie with very hard to understand logic for most people. But I enjoyed it."
" Tenet - A Mind-Bending Action Spectacle
",LisaJones_1,9,14 April 2023,"If you're a fan of Christopher Nolan's work, you won't be disappointed by his latest film, Tenet. This action-packed sci-fi thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The movie is visually stunning, with mind-bending action sequences that will leave you speechless. The soundtrack, composed by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson, is perfectly fitting for the movie's intense and suspenseful moments.John David Washington and Robert Pattinson have excellent chemistry as the movie's leads. Their performances are nothing short of phenomenal. Elizabeth Debicki and Kenneth Branagh also deliver standout performances.One of the most impressive aspects of the movie is the way it plays with time. Without giving anything away, the concept of inversion is both fascinating and confusing, and it's implemented flawlessly.Overall, Tenet is a must-see movie for anyone who loves action, sci-fi, or mind-bending thrillers. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth watching on the big screen.Quote: ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it."" - Neil (Robert Pattinson)"
" Good movie, bad plot
",McDiarmid23,6,13 April 2023,"When I watched Tenet I was really excited at first because you are immediately thrown into the plot and have no idea, but from time to time you understand the story. However, after some time I got bored because there was not so much tension as in other spy and heist movies. I loved to see Kenneth Branagh in this playing the villain, but other actors played their role not as good as I wished they would. I have to say that the plot is very boring after some time and then it feels like you're wasting your time when you watch more of it. I watched the whole movie but I had the same feeling. To sum it up: Boring plot, good shots, Bad acting, bad dialogues, and you cannot really understand the story."
" Convoluted mess
",donegalcat,5,8 April 2023,"Tenet too often feels like an overly long gimmick because the film lacks the plot, the characters or the acting to hold the attention otherwise. The film shows technical accomplishment in depicting action in reverse but that is about it.The plot is a convoluted mess and long before the end I lost interest in trying to follow it.There may be multiple timelines and versions of the characters, but the film doesn't make them interesting enough to care. John David Washington in the lead role lacks charisma and isn't strong enough to carry the film. Branagh's accent is all over the place as the weak Russian villain. Pattinson does better as the stereotypical shady fixer while Debicki is solid as the damsel in distress.Going into this I was hoping for something along the lines of Inception but instead Tenet just continues the long decline from Christopher Nolan since that 2010 hit."
" I wonder if the actors in this understood the plot?
",andrew-huggett,1,7 April 2023,Tried to watch this - gave up on it about an hour from the end. What a mess! There are a couple of moderately exciting set pieces but the narrative structure of this film went over my head. I feel it's trying too hard to be clever and really it's probably quite a simple story. It wasn't helped by the music which was very loud drowning out the dialog. Very disappointing. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on the 4K disc - at least it was cheap. I might give it another go at some future point. I wasn't even all that impressed with the picture quality - it didn't look much better than a standard blu-ray. The opening sequence was completely incomprehensible and didn't seem to have any relevance to the rest of the film. I wonder if the actors in this film knew what was going on plot wise?
" Needs Repeat Viewing to Enjoy, but there's a downside.
",Jimmy_The_Jacobite,8,26 March 2023,"Nolan has quite the brain creating science fiction, but this complex idea is one of the few that translated to have a fair understanding. Very interesting perspective preventing nuclear holocaust with the introduction of time travel as the core to its story. Visually its memorable, but needs repeat viewing to have understanding of rules why the story plays out the way it does. The unfortunate part of this film, John Washington isn't convincing as the lead. His persona is forced, lacks charisma & becomes less believable of a character that is capable as such for the story. Patterson is surprisingly good. This film is extremely complex in story, needs time to put together."
" Decided not to waste anymore of my time
",sleepingsunrise,5,25 March 2023,"I really wanted to like this movie. I became interested in it because of Robert Pattinson and it being directed by Nolan.I typically give movies 30 minutes to impress me because I HATE wasting my time. I tried watching this one twice and ultimately gave up about an hour into it. An hour is generous for me. I gave it that much because I know many of Nolan's films are a slow burn and worth the wait.The concept makes no sense and they don't even bother trying to make it make sense. They even tell you ""Don't try to understand it"". Yeah, I won't.The action and dialogue was too quick to keep up. It basically looked like watching a movie on rewind.Ultimately the reason why I turned it off was because I got tired of watching the wife be terrorized by the ex-husband. It was sickening.If only I could go back in time and not watch this movie."
" It's amazing and it drives you crazy
",ahmedyo,8,23 March 2023,"Christopher Nolan is a crazy and insane person. There is no dispute about this. What Nolan is trying to convey to the viewers is an adventure that is difficult to imagine on your own. It is also difficult to imagine its events and facts. It is also difficult to photograph many moments. Fear that my mind will be distracted by this wonderful drama.The story of the film is about the attempt of some people to stop the end of the world. This person is known in this film as the Protagonist, as he does not know anything about the mission or how to end the world except for one word, which is Tenet, and the meaning of this word will appear through the events of the film, but frankly, the aesthetic of talking about this film lies In penetrating the events and talking comfortably about the events of the movie.The photography was aesthetic with things that neither the mind nor the eye could have expected while you were sitting in front of the screen. The photographic ability in this film exceeded many stages and reached a stage of dazzling. It exceeded the choice of angles or even the duration of the shot. We have different dimensions and a new method in how to photograph.The aesthetic of the story is not in asking ourselves what the story is. The aesthetic of the story is in how the story is told and explained. The narrative of the story and the photographic capabilities greatly exceeded the events of the story and anything else in the film, where scientific and physical facts and theories were used that greatly assist in storytelling. They greatly help in explaining the events and how they pass. Events and these scientific theories and physical facts that boggle your mind and drive you crazy have made my eyes stop closing while my time to sleep came."
" Imperfect, Complex, Multiple Viewings Required
",blakechesledon,8,19 March 2023,"Huge Nolan fan here. I would say that Interstellar is not only my favorite movie but in my opinion the single best movie I have ever seen.Tenet is not as good as Interstellar. I respect Nolan for how much he expects of his audience; he wants the people who watch his films to pay close attention to every detail. My problem with that, at least with Tenet, is that even when you watch with subtitles (which is necessary considering how dense some of the dialogue is and how difficult it is to hear at times) AND when you are intently paying attention you can still be completely lost. There are several sequences where if you miss a single line of dialogue, you will have no idea what or why the characters are doing what they are doing in the next scene. I am not a dumb person, but this movie requires several viewings to even hope to understand. I think that is primarily where this movie's faults lie; viewers are punished for even a momentary lapse of attention. I am not a fan of expository dialogue as a general rule, but this movie could have used a few more scenes that explained what was going on.A movie requiring at least two or three viewings can be off-putting to some, and understandably so. But if you do give this movie a couple of chances, it will reward you. Some truly epic, mind-bending action sequences with characters moving forward and backward in time simultaneously. These scenes become more epic once you grasp the idea of inversion. An original plot (relatively, it is essentially a spy movie), and once you have seen it a few times it feels pretty cool to ""get it."" Several orders of magnitude more difficult to follow than Inception, and not quite as good, but still a very good modern action film that isn't about superheroes."
" Not for all, but for some
",ZinedineElbaroni,8,13 March 2023,"Tenet is a cinematic masterpiece that takes you on an exciting and surprising journey through time and space. From the first scene you are immersed in a world of intrigue and danger that keeps you in suspense throughout the film. Be told. The action sequences are really good, and the visual effects are great.The cast is phenomenal, with John David Washington giving an outstanding performance in the lead role. Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki also excel in their respective roles, bringing depth and nuance to their characters.But what sets Tenet apart is his sheer ambition. This is a movie that demands your full attention and rewards you for it. Challenge.In short, Tenet is a love letter to cinema, an exhilarating ride that pushes the boundaries of what is possible on screen. If you're looking for a breathtaking film that keeps you pondering its mysteries long after the credits roll, look no further than Tenet."
" Damned good try
",xyqkp,7,10 March 2023,"Putting aside the ham-handed effort to explain the physics, which was unavoidable since it's clear no physicist was ever asked to look at the plausibility of the script, the overall premise wasn't awful. The first 30-45 minutes quite muddled the premise by trying to create suspense where there was no need for any yet; choosing to open with a James Bond spy ambience was the wrong choice. And, oddly, in the end the very premise itself completely eliminated any suspense in the ending (because, we knew the world wasn't going to be deleted, so we knew almost to the smallest detail what was going to happen). That's not really a failure on this movie's fault; such circuitous and ""destiny"" oriented premises always run that risk. With such premises you need to look for suspense in some fashion other than the question of whether destiny is real or not. The ""destroy everything or nothing"" premise could not be the key suspense point. If, for example, they'd focused the critical ending question of where the protagonist and the girl would get together, they'd have posed a question that could go either way ... and therefore been suspenseful. I've only ever seen one ""end of the world"" movie where focus successfully stayed on whether the world would end or not ... and surprisingly, it did ... and then more surprisingly, it didn't.Clearly a WHOLE lot of effort was put into thinking through the visual implications of forward/backward time travel. Some very inventive chase and fight scenes, and especially seeing the same sequences played out first in forward time and then again later in reverse time. A huge scripting effort and an even greater, monumental continuity effort. Unfortunately, as one might expect for a task this large and complex, there were quite a few perspective failures. But, perhaps, the greatest failure was in audio. Faces covered in masks (perhaps a bit stupid overkill-one asks why air needed to be reversed when literally nothing else in the forward world needed to be) are fine visualizations, but in a movie this fast paced, all I can say is I'm damned glad I streamed it so I could go back over and over again: in a theater, mumbled clues to a complex story like this is the same thing as not bother to explain anything. People can't concentrate the necessary effort for two hours on hearing, listening, and understanding without getting migraines. The movie was clearly not shown to anyone not already familiar with the premise before editing was complete. The movie would gone up 2 ratings on IMDB if people had actually heard and understood the details of the premise and its implications, but alas far too many reviews were posted here by people who either couldn't spend the effort to understand or wouldn't.Any time you combine a frenzied presentation with a complex premise like time travel with no meaningful opportunity to pause and think, you're just going to lose your audience along the way. And while there were a huge number of time-travel nuances in the closing scenes, I wager most people missed at least half of them.Perhaps I'm a bit of an elitist in thinking I did get them and many others didn't, but that's not exactly the way to maximize your profits making a movie."
" bloated & pretentious
",Chris_Ego,2,9 March 2023,"I have to admit crashing a real plane with practical effects was a highlight, but this doesn't make ""Tenet"" a good action movie. I'd say it's Nolands worst project since this film tries so hard to be unique it gets lost in the sands of its own time. When ""Tenet"" was released in 2020 everybody was hyped about the way how the reverse footage was shot. This is interesting but doesn't look convincing all the time. The fight at the airport is tedious and unwillingly funny, especially when the SWAT like guys are crawling backwards on the floor making funny shoe noises like they played basketball on the school court. The first hour goes by fast and so much happens in this time yet little I did understand. They keep talking too much too fast and Blondie is whispering when she is the one spreading important clues. Nolan fails to star the ""Protagonist"" in a likeable way and therefor the film just presses on without any connection to the lead. Robert Pattinson did a nice job as his sidekick Neil and I am so looking forward to see him starring the ""Batman"". Oops, I lost it there. Yeah, Tenet is a waste of your precious watching time."
" Tall Drink of Water
",sure_man,4,8 March 2023,"Although this was victimized by COVID, even after an impressive pre-release marketing campaign, the film is just not that good. A classic B-movie with an A-level budget, frenetic (bordering on incoherent) editing and a silly spin on searching for horcruxes (reference intended), the moebius strip time spin just didn't really work. Maybe the bonding agents are on the editing room floor somewhere, but I'm sure the book not based on the movie is much for fulfilling and illuminates the internal workings of the characters beyond ""save my child"" and ""I hate life so I'm taking everyone with me"". This is comic book level stuff for a work alleging to be of substance. The character motivations are ridiculously thin and cliched. Much of the monotone dialogue lacks punch and vitality. For all the pretension, this is nothing more than smoke and mirrors."
" A Mind-Bending and Spectacular Spy Thriller
",FilmFanatic2023,8,4 March 2023,"Tenet is a sci-fi action film directed by Christopher Nolan that revolves around a secret agent who uses time inversion to prevent a global catastrophe. The film is a dazzling display of Nolan's signature style, featuring stunning visuals, complex plot twists, and thrilling action sequences. The film also explores themes of free will, fate, and entropy. John David Washington leads the cast as the Protagonist, a charismatic and skilled spy who teams up with Neil (Robert Pattinson), a mysterious ally. Kenneth Branagh plays Andrei Sator, a ruthless Russian oligarch who seeks to destroy the world.I enjoyed Tenet for its ambitious and original concept, its impressive cinematography, its exhilarating pace, and its clever dialogue. I think Christopher Nolan delivered another masterpiece that challenges and entertains the audience. I would recommend Tenet to fans of sci-fi who appreciate a fast-paced and intricate film that requires multiple viewings to fully understand."
" Another masterpiece crafted by the one and only Christopher Nolan
",Nicholas_HY,10,20 February 2023,"My only regret was not watching this in the theatres. Well, streaming this has its own advantages like you can rewind and watch the specific scene's ""before and after."" I find that most of the bad reviews talk about the plot and while I agree that the plot will be confusing for a majority of the people but once you get a grasp of it you will awe and appreciate this even more. Even the soundtrack was just perfect for this movie, I'm actually glad that Nolan didn't use Zimmer for this project because his style wasn't suitable. While the action sequences are decent, I'd recommend this movie for its story and plot because I myself enjoys a good intricate mystery/thriller stuffs. Nolan is truly one of the best of our time."
" Another amazing film by Christopher Nolan
",Reviewosaurus,9,19 February 2023,"After a near-death experience during a CIA operation, the Protagonist is recruited to join a government organization called Tenet, tasked with preventing World World III. The time inversion aspect of the film was so interesting and different; I've never seen anything like it in another film. You will probably be confused throughout the movie, but by the end, everything comes together. I like how the characters were portrayed and written, but one thing I felt this movie was lacking was a solid antagonist. I love this film, it's mind-blowing, gripping, and thought-provoking, and I would highly recommend it."
" Worth to watch
",giedriavas,8,17 February 2023,"A film will discover both fans and those who will enjoy less. Nolan is trying to apply the ideas we saw in his previous fantastic films,but also discovered something new - what is worth seeing in cinema and seeing more than once at home. Without telling the story of the film,one can only ask questions - what if onr way or another ? So the film is kind of divided into two parts. It is necessary and possible to watch from the very first minutes and you will get into the story perfectly. Fun to see know or lesser known actors ,becouse in the movie a lot of action,well that charisma was even more. After movie the music track was not known to me,but when i heard it in cinema after movie..damn... the whirlwinds were walking for generations."
" A movie that bit more than it could chew
",dargosmunteanu,8,17 February 2023,"The concept behind Tenet is a very interesting one, but also very difficult to implement in a movie and probably even more important, vaguely explained and expanded upon throughout the runtime. That last bit is probably its downfall, stated rules that govern its function aren't consistently abided by, making the whole adventure sketchy at best.Acting was good, action scenes were interesting, the story could've been solid if the whole time-traveling mechanic would've been treated in a more traditional manner.It may not have ended up being a high concept sci-fi movie, but it would've been a more consistent and, overall, ejoyable long (yeah, a bit too long, maybe?) cinematic experience.Worth the watch, but it may require of you to fill in a lot of blanks that the writers and technology left within it."
" Phantasy of a genius director but a plain movie
",furkankilickap,8,14 February 2023,"Christopher Nolan's filmography has, in my view, a registered position in the history of cinema; however, with this movie Nolan cannot carry himself further when we compare Tenet with his former works, most of which had box office-recorded movies.There is an unique idea about ""time inverting"" but the idea is not fit on the action based story which has full of cliches. Concept of inverting can be easy to understand from the perspective of Nolan undoubtedly, but I'm sure that audience may have difficulty to understand the idea scene by scene upon the actions of the characters or from the story because action genre has fast-paced storytelling; nonetheless, you can get the idea and what Nolan is trying to say in general. So I agree with some critics saying that Nolan made this movie just for himself.Besides, background of the characters are empty unfortunately. You cannot feel empathy for the protagonist or cannot understand the motivation of some characters to a certain extent but performances of actresses & actors quite well - especially John David Washington.From cinematographic and musical perspectives, the movie makes real the atmosphere and the world. For the last five years Hoyte Van Hoytema (DP) and Ludwig GÃ¶ransson (composer) have the names proved themselves in their professions, and they deserve some credits specifically for this movie.Although Tenet has full of bad criticism according to a stereotypical action based movie, you can feel the magical and dazzling touch of a master director with an idea that wasn't thought before. Therefore, the movie deserves to be watched & a score above average.TRIVIA: Contains no green screens, just practical effects. This includes the inversion sequences, for which director Christopher Nolan chose instead to shoot each scene twice: one time moving forward, and once with the actors doing everything backward. (BIND BLOWING DIRECTING 101)"
" Loud and impenetrable
",Quinoa_Chris_Kirk,1,8 February 2023,"A man on an international mission to save the world from the deadliest weapon of all, the future.Two moods: excessive incomprehensible exposition and LOUD incomprehensible action sequences. At no point do you know what is going on, nor are you given any reason to care. It is at all times tedious, meaningless and irritating. None of the characters are remotely interesting, much of the dialogue is inaudible and the ridiculous convolutions add up to nothing. And this cost over $200 million to make.Here Nolan has retreated deeply, unpleasantly and unforgivably into his own idiosyncrasy and left his loyal audience scrambling to come up with excuses for him."
" Didn't finish watching it !!!
",jayydee3,5,5 February 2023,"The main actor is not great. Mumbles his words, his appearance doesn't fit in with the people he is dealing with and no class. Not a James Bond type at all. The story was confusing and and far too long to keep your attention. Not exciting and certainly not believable as far as the main actor went. I think it had the makings of a very good file if the casting had been different in the main roles. This turned out to be just a mess. I got to the point that I just couldn't watch it any further and turned it off. Could have been much better with some more experienced actors and
a better script. All in all very poorly done movie."
" Too clever for its own good - just as another reviewer said
",kambomambos,2,5 February 2023,"Had potential but way too complicated. Had to watch with subtitles and continuously rewind to work out what was going on - even then we were unclear. If it was simplified a little and the dialogue made clearer (in every way) it would have been much more enjoyable. Put aside an extra hour for stopping and rewinding if you're gonna watch this one.Well acted and characters were solid but if you can't hear what they are saying, particularly when they are talking non-sensical physics and time travel it's very difficult to follow. Good cast, great effects but without clarity it's unfortunately a frustrating waste of three hours."
" basic premise is stupid
",cleeds-27588,1,31 January 2023,"The basic premise is that a scientist in the future invents time reversing devices, regrets her invention as too dangerous, so instead of destroying it she decides to send them back in time to out present, where a mad Russian oligarch somehow discovers all this and decides to use the invention to destroy the present world because we are destroying the environment - quite how or why he thought this would work is never mentioned, because it is too ridiculous. That, or we just have to accept that he is mad, or the future people told him it was the only way. He does it because he is dying and his madness makes him think if he can't live then no one else can either - or something. It is not clear which, so pick'n'mix as you like. Time travel movies never work. Never. Basically it's an excuse for a lot of Bond style fist fights, explosions, crashes, car chases, random violence. As with Bond, the baddie has an unending supply of incredibly gullible and stupid helpers all over the world who are quite happy to be killed and maimed on his behalf, and set off these devices on command from the baddie as he lounges on his mega-yacht. Just terrible."
" In a few words, a waste of time...
",jesusroblesazul,5,31 January 2023,"Well, I could suffer much more with this absurd movie, but i was enough wise to avoid the suffering. Why people try to understand garbage like this? When at a first sight you can see the final result: a protagonist without personality, scenes plenty of unnecessary violence, excess of special effects, and at last an clumsy attempt to make up the mediocrity of the film using some well known actors with no results. I can accept mister Nolan isa very distinguished director. In fact, I enjoy very much most oh his work, but this time, what Can I say: this work is a failure in many ways, a very boring movie in despite of all the action the director adds at any moment. Anyway, a waste of time..."
" My head hurts
",benpulford-82589,10,29 January 2023,"I've watched many great films that the more I watch, the more I understand the plot. But, with this film, the less I understand it!!! Why? Why? Why? How the heck did Meister Nolan get this past the producers? Not that I'm complaining. It truly is a great, great film. It's just...that it defies all logic. Is Christopher Nolan from the future? I was intrigued to note there is a reference to Oppenheimer in the film and as we no know Nolan is making / has been making a bio-pic about Oppenheimer. Or is that statement a spolier? Is a spolier a spolier if it's written in the future about the past? Or is it - is a spolier a spolier if it's written in the past about the future? My head hurts...for all the right reasons. Very much looking forward to Oppenheimer!"
" For all its ambition, 'Tenet' is a mushy glob of nonsense.
",punch_p,3,29 January 2023,"This summer, in anticipation of the release of Tenet, I wrote a piece defending the position of Christopher Nolan as not merely a filmmaker of huge commercial clout, but as someone whose quality of work on an artistic, cinematographic, and emotional (yes, I wrote that!) level merits proper appreciation too. I did post a warning though that Nolan's increasing reverence for tech and his control freak tendencies were threatening to outweigh that lovely dichotomy he had always been able to blend between all things genre and his metaphysically-inflected narratives.With Tenet, Nolan totally oversteps that line and has turned in a work that runs dangerously close to self-satire. While I would argue his previous ten films have always possessed some portion of an emotional edge amid the viscerality of their storytelling, Tenet is, simply, a spectatorial dead weight. It is completely lacking in tension and is just a film endlessly stuck in the cycle of explaining and justifying itself and its conceit (perhaps an unintended, ironic echo of its central theme of inversion). Copious exposition is nothing new to a Nolan film, but comprehensiblity and an emotional core always co-existed with that philosophical bent. Even Memento - a film which loosely echoes the tricks of Tenet with a focus on a narrative being played in reverse - was able to conjure three-dimensional character arcs out of those thematics. In Tenet, however, the characters remain (unintentionally) flat, which is borne out when the Protagonist's climactic conversation with Neil and his one last look at Kat don't carry the dramatic pay-off Nolan is clearly angling for.Even in Nolan's lesser guise as a purveyor of spectacle, Tenet falls flat. For all the lustre, gravitas and awe Nolan applies to his action sequences (I'm thinking about the exploding jumbo, the billionaire's yacht, the racing boats), he's unable to aestheticise these for his audience the way his idol, Michael Mann, can. It's because Mann's action scenes are always connected to the ethics and emotion of his stories, whereas Nolan's function as extraneous gorging on extreme financial, technological and industrial might."
" Whoa...if you thought 'Inception' was mind-blowing...just wait!
",cochrandarin,8,29 January 2023,"Ok, I had to watch Inception about 3 times to, uh, get it. You'll have to watch this one about five. The concept is mind-blowing with the whole inversion of time and reversed entropy through the continium, or...something like that. Basically, folks in the future have figured out how to send something traveling backwards through time. So, future bullets that have already been fired are sent spiraling backwards and end up back in the magazine of the gun someone is holding before they've even fired it. If that sounds complicated, just wait till cars and humans start going backwards. The complex part is when they all start meeting themselves and the plot folds and unfolds...is revisited...is changed...is observed by their other selves just across the battlefield...etc. Etc. Etc...you get the picture. All the while, our hero (who is not named and is just referred to as the 'Protagonist') is trying to thwart this dangerous technology, which has obviously ended up in the wrong hands, from destroying the world. Not by sending a nuke back into the hands of Hitler and the SS, but even worse; Using some kinda complicated math algorithm to create a doomsday bomb. Or at least I THINK that's what he was doing. I tried to tell my 9th grade Calculus teacher that not only was math useless, turns out IT's DANGEROUS!!Anyhow, the acting is great. The lead guy does good. Robert Pattinson from Twilight fame, is the lead character's, uh...side-kick and he does just fine. Elizabeth Dibicki does great as the...well, it's complicated. You'll just have to watch and figure it out for yourself. The truth is, you could say that about most of this movie. The plot is so complex and quick-moving that we found ourselves rewinding many times to review a line here and there that was important to what was going on. I think I'm a fairly smart guy, I have a doctorate and even an undergrad bachelor of science degree. I have even written a sci-fi book, so I thought I would 'get it' maybe a little better than the average fella walking through Walmart that works as an auto mechanic (no offense to that line of work) but even I felt myself raising an eyebrow many times while watching this movie. It's so confusing at times that I even asked my bunch; ""How many average folks would have turned this off by now?""It's not to say that it isn't entertaining. It's definitely original and the special effects are beyond mind-blowing and it redefines the phrase ""plot twists""!So, give it a try and be prepared to plan on watching again, and maybe again. Grab a plate of chocolate chip cookies and pull up a sofa by the fire on a weekend night with the fam when you got nothing stressful on your mind to distract you. You'll definitely need a clear head to try and navigate through this one.Enjoy...."
" Nolan really wants us to believe he is a genius
",LawrenceLambleg,5,29 January 2023,"I'm honestly baffled how could a director with an incredible debut like Memento go so far down his own rabbit holes.Plot - pretty original and very cool concepts, but so poorly executed. Whatever works in this movie is quickly ruined by exposition.Pacing - too much action, too much dialogue you keep missing because of loud music and too much noise. They tried to cram so much stuff in two and a half hours and this movie could easily do without half of its content.Dialogue - there are no characters in this movie. The only purpose of every character is to tell you where the plot is going, just in case you were too stupid to figure it out. So there's no dialogue really. Just Nolan holding the viewer's hand through this mess of a movie through different characters. So when the characters speak to each other, it feels like you're watching the director's commentary rather than an actual movie.Acting - both Pattinson and Michael Caine are wasted here. Washington doesn't have a character. His character doesn't even have a name, he is called ""The Protagonist"" and the big plot twist of this movie is that he IS in fact THE PROTAGONIST. Bravo, Nolan! Kenneth Brannagh plays every Russian villain you've ever seen in campy 80s and 90s action movies. He is the worst thing about this movie in my opinion. If they hired someone better to play Sator, I would've at least had some motivation to sit through the movie. It's not most of the actors' fault that they don't have actual characters to work with, but Kenneth Brannagh really screws this up.The ol' switcheroo of continuity - the entire second half of this movie is just one big continuity error. This is probably the most unforgivable crime that this movie commits. Nolan seems to just switch the reversal of time on and off to make this contrived plot work. You see the entire world supposedly go into reverse, but all of the characters are moving forwards in time so you can follow the actual plot, even the ones that aren't ""inverted"". If they really committed to the time reversal, it would've been beautiful, but no... characters keep ""inverting"" themselves for the sake of comprehensive storytelling. You watch the movie, then you get confused by something that doesn't make sense and a character appears not a second later to tell you ""ah, you see... I inverted myself back then... so now I'm dead, but actually I was dead..."" Yeah, sure... You really wanna blow us away, Nolan? Don't do a half-assed attempt at time-reversal where everybody talks and walks normal. Make the second half actually reversed... It would've been way better to be confusing, rather than just pretending to be clever. The movie explicitly tells you ""don't try to understand it"" and then feels the need to keep explaining itself to you for two hours... In its best moments this movie had no exposition. If Nolan lets things just happen without any pointless explanation, I think his movies would've been way better than they are."
" It's different
",thisisstepercival,6,27 January 2023,"Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly a great filmmaker, although personally I find his films very hit and miss - The Dark Knight is outstanding and even played as a straight cops and robbers movie instead of a superhero film that still stands. Likewise with The Prestige, another simply perfect film. On the flip side of that he gives us say, Dunkirk which for me was more than disappointing. Anyway, Tenet falls smack back in the middle. It's not a masterclass in filmmaking nor is it disappointing. It looks incredible and it's action packed and full of the trucks you'd expect from a Nolan film. However, it's just too convoluted and hard to follow. It's a bit too clever for its own good which sometimes can be a good thing but to most casual viewers it's just not worth the effort. I have watched it 3 times now and I admit it gets better with each viewing but you probably shouldn't need to watch something half a dozen times to fully grasp the story or what's going on. If you struggled with Inception then seriously give Tenet a miss it'll just leave you with a headache. If you want to watch it to be dazzled by jaw dropping set pieces then give it a go. It's not a bad film it just pushes filmmaking to new limits which isn't a bad thing.On a footnote it would be interesting to see what Nolan could do if he was given the opportunity to helm a Bond movie because there's possibly no-one better at action sequences around right now."
" Great idea - told mediocre
",spam-778-616598,6,26 January 2023,"The idea is great, the plot points should work for most people - but it's told in a too confusing way. And I love complex stories! This just wasn't written very well. The special effects were great, of course, but the heroes goal was missing and the reason why we should care for him. It was all too confusing - I couldn't remember the characters or their stories, I didn't get most of the connections ... and that's coming from someone who loved a truly complex story like Dark. What looked extremely promising, turned out quite boring - my husband fell asleep at the end, because he couldn't follow anyway anymore. I say it's worth a watch - because the idea was great after all."
" The thing on which the movie is built
",Zeyders,7,25 January 2023,"Christopher Nolan's films always delight with their ideas, the quality of the films, and this film is no exception. But the film has its pluses and minuses in every moment.The main thing on which the film is built is made qualitatively and difficult, but the explanation of this chip lasts almost the entire film. The whole main plot is built on this concept, which can't be called a minus, but also can't be a plus. The characters are not revealed, but the main characters are memorable. The special effects, the only thing, remain unqualified because Nolan prefers to recreate them live.It's a good movie to watch. Interesting action, a concept that you see for the first time in movies exactly like this."
" Complex or complicated?
",tpvmpdbm,6,24 January 2023,"Tenet really wants to be a complex movie which feels like something you can not understand. And this kind of overwhelming story works. But to be honest it doesn't work to me.It's not really complex...you just can't understand what is going on because the scenes are switching so fast, you are always busy to follow it.At least the characters are not overwhelming. But in favor they are boring. You can not feel with them or see any progress they are going threw. They are just random characters who you will forget if you are rewatching tenet in the future.But also it is really interesting to watch and challenging your mind. Can you follow the story the first time you are watching tenet? Maybe yes or maybe not. It doesn't matter because it is not a movie you should understand and this is what makes it complicated and not complex...even if tenet wants to be complicated. After the first time you haved watched tenet there is nothing you can think about and just your aha-moment of understanding what the heck was going on the last two hours."
" It requires a lot of complex aches
",dr_hgj-48231,10,22 January 2023,"C Nolan must be clapped as his team gave yet another complex scientific but confusing mixtures of all possible twist n turn exploring reversible time machine, reversing even physical, chemical, emotional,, all.... nal and....... cal limits crossed in confusing the film watcher.

Giving current focus of Uranium, relationships, interest what next alive, fights, stunts, modern gazzets, reversible bullets weapons, every thing except human grid negativity kept growing!!!!

" A feast of vision and thought
",s-19392,8,22 January 2023,"I am a loyal fan of director Nolan. I have watched and enjoyed every film of his without exception. I think he is the director who really understands the art of film. For this film, I call it the feast of vision because I am really affected by every shot of it. Every shot, every picture, and every frame are individually captured as a work of art. In terms of the overall picture environment, this is the only work I feel comfortable with. In other words, I want you to watch it again. This is a very difficult thing for a science fiction film, And the director did it, which really made me very happy. The above is my feeling from the perspective of direct sense. Next, let's talk about the plot. As usual, I don't talk about the details. I admit that I may be a little stupid. When I saw the film for the first time, I didn't see the specific content of the story. The specific story is really a little complicated, but one thing is worth affirming. Although the story is complex and difficult, But there are no films with complex plots, which annoy the audience. After seeing them, they will never watch them for the second time. But this film is different. After watching it for the first time, you can't understand it. You will be eager to see it for the second time and the third time until you understand it. It is like a strong magnetic magnet, which has always attracted you to explore it. I especially admire the director's thinking ability. I have seen AI before, It was the first time I was attracted by him. After so long and watching so many films, I am very honest to tell you that he has not changed. This film also provided me with great inspiration in the creative process. The expression of ""transformation"" and the very artistic treatment also provided me with a lot of good help."
" More fantasy than sci-fi, but in a good way
",noxaman,7,20 January 2023,"This is at its heart a time travel film, with a twist. As long as you don't try too hard to explain every little detail, the film is an enjoyable spy thriller with a completely original spin.Upon a second viewing I was surprised to find myself not getting lost in the (now obvious) foreshadowing, but rather the sheer scale of the effort it must have taken to conceptualize and direct such a monster of a story. The movie is a soft-7, but the direction is a solid-10. That is to say, there's no way this story could have been told any better than it was. Telos in film.Tenet is an obvious passion project, and while it's not my favorite film of the year, it is without a doubt the most innovative and best directed piece I have seen in a long time."
" It's one of those films that you beg for it to finish
",lucaspvirano,7,18 January 2023,"Despite being an entertaining film with a superb sci-fy time-related concept behind and impressive visuals, Tenet is practically unbearable to watch. It expects too much from the audience (and not only on following the convoluted plot). 2 and a 1/2 hours of such high-intensity action is brain-melting. At first said continous intensity makes the movie very appealing but as the plot develops, the mental energy from the audience diminishes. The result? Migraine + the desire of the end of the play.To sum up, if you are into spionage and action films, you will enjoy it. But if you can't tolerate prolonged unclear action display, you will suffer watching it (as I did). In a nutshell: a peculiar hybrid of a popcorn action film with a high-IQ nolanesque attach."
" Too slick and clever.
",Pyst_Moo,4,16 January 2023,"If you want to spend this amount of time getting a bit of a headache, I'd suggest picking a different activity, it will feel less pretentious.This films tries way to hard to be slick and clever, and should spend a little more time making the plot work - it's undoubtedly a good idea, but the execution, for me at least, was way to messy.I've read that it takes a few viewings to really understand all the threads and how they interweave. But, truly, who has time for that when the first viewing wasn't anything I'd want to do again.Added to that, I wished I'd looked up the cast... this film just adds to my theory that Branagh is the most overrated actor of his generation."
" A Flashy Disappointment
",BoraGungorTirmis,1,15 January 2023,"Christopher Nolan, known for his mind-bending, complex thrillers such as ""Inception"" and ""Memento."" However, in the case of ""Tenet"", it falls short of expectations. The film's plot, while marketed as complex and intricate, is actually quite straightforward and easy to predict. The main character, played by John David Washington, is also not well-developed or relatable.The film's action scenes and visual effects are well-done, but the music and sound effects are overpowering and can be overwhelming. The film's focus on action and special effects leaves little room for character development, making it a shallow and unsatisfying experience.Overall, ""Tenet"" is a disappointment. It fails to live up to the high expectations set by Nolan's previous work and falls short as a complex thriller. The film is loud and flashy, but it fails to engage the audience emotionally or intellectually. It's a bad action movie that fails to deliver on its promises."
" An action movie that actually engages your brain
",Louise1586,10,14 January 2023,"The acting is outstanding. Visual effects are top-notch. The score is perfect. Yes, you might have to watch this more than once. But that's my standard for any good movie: you want to see it again, don't you?Don't watch this expecting a run-of-the-mill popcorn flick. Christopher Nolan makes movies for people who like to use their brains. And thank goodness for that. There are plenty of mindless movies out there with explosions and car chases that require very few neurons.I have to laugh at the reviews that take aim at how the time travel/inversion doesn't make sense. Unless someone has successfully time traveled, and lived to tell the story, not sure they can really say what ""makes sense"" or not. The idea of time travel (or in this case ""inversion"") is open to creative interpretation. That's the joy of storytelling, isn't it?In summary: It's not a bad movie just because you don't understand it.I give it a solid 10/10."
" Christopher Nolan is a mastermind
",MatthewMichaelHoffman,10,14 January 2023,"SCORE: TBDThis is the first time I am not scoring a movie and it is because I still truly do not understand it, but I can I just tell that it's amazing. I've read a few articles on it and even watched a couple YouTube videos, but I still can't fully wrap my head around it. Like many other Nolan films such as Memento and Inception, you aren't going to pick up on everything upon first watch, which still makes him the best and most interesting director in my opinion. However, Tenet is the first of his movies that I just felt completely lost after the first watch. There is something to be said about the human mind and it's power to learn, ultimately becoming the subject matter expect in things we dedicate our time to. It's amazing how smart we can come off when describing something so simple to us, yet so complicated to the other 95% of people we interact with. Christopher Nolan is a mastermind and his ability to come up with stories like this is unparalleled. I know that one day I will fully understand what this movie is about, but until then I will continue to research and try to understand every aspect of it. Whether bad or good, there is no denying the uniqueness of this film and what it does to its audience members."
" When you have to do more and more
",danimar75,5,11 January 2023,"Difficult to handle a paradox. It gave me the impression that he wanted to go the extra mile. Apart from originality, the story seems to me to suffer. Nolan likes to complicate the plots and build a mosaic that realizes a picture only at the end. But in this case I've lost the enjoyment of experiencing the narrative journey in the context of a realization that did not convey credibility to me. So many minutes to say something that perhaps could have been told in a few. There are other topics in modern physics that I would like to see.The intention to create something new in a film world of sequels is to be commended. But is it so hard to find good inspirations?"
" Painful to watch
",p-t-watson,3,10 January 2023,"I went to see this at the cinema and like most I was completely confused about what was happening.The story is not that revealing and lots of unobvious sub plotting make it difficult to engage with. What's worse is the sound decisions; low vocal sound, high volume backing soundtrack. This seems to be deliberate but why would you mess with the sound in a movie. It's completely distractingSo I watched it at home and have since read about the main plot which is a pretty original idea. I then wanted to like the movie.However, the most distracting issue that permeates the movie and prevents me from liking it is John Washington. He has a severe lack of presence, is dry dull and boring. He is a terrible actor, extremely incongruous with the scenes.His acting is in the same league of the likes of East enders, not a high level movie like Tenet, directed by one the lead directors of the 21st century. What a fail in casting. The decision to cast Washington alongside a much more talented side such as Robert Pattinson is obsurd. Major fail in what could be an insightful movie.Painful to watch and boring to see so much lead acting with such limited range!"
" Hocus Pocus
",aalreetmarra,5,6 January 2023,"The basic concept of the film is one that we've seen many times before. It's the usual villain in the fight between good and evil and is predictably Russian. This time instead of having a nuclear device to end the world he has an algorithm. An algorithm is an ordered or systematic set of instructions to resolve a problem. Also introduced here is entropy: high entropy disorder, low entropy order, so the concept of the film appears to be a contradiction as the villain is in favor of the high entropy, disorder. The villain goes about achieving his end goal by using an ordered, planned set of instructions contained in the algorithm in his possession. Yes, that is correct; in a nutshell, the concept is simply insane. He achieves his aim by using a time machine called in the script a ""turnstile,"" a very inventively futuristic device that you would come across in many mundane situations in real life. So we have Sator, the villain, married to Kat, played by Elizabeth Debicki, who is the best thing to watch in the film itself. She is in an unhappy marriage, which she wants to get out of, but as we go along in the script, Kat reveals that Sator has terminal pancreatic cancer. Is that not a big error in this story? Why didn't she just wait until he died? Then we have this unnamed CIA operative known as the protagonist, John David Washington. As is customary, a love interest with Kat is introduced, or perhaps this highly trained spy and killer's weak spot is that he just comes undone by any beautiful woman. Yes, apparently this happens a lot in the CIA, L. O. L. In reality, we live on the only known planet in the known universe, which has everything that is needed to sustain all life in our own ordered solar system. The disorder we are seeing now is caused by the antagonists who want to maintain their own order of me first and, in that process, let's get as rich as we can and to hell with the consequences. They are opposed by protagonists who wish to the current state of affairs, which will eventually lead to the destruction of our eco-system and the extinction of all life. Entropy is a scientific concept, just as evolution is an unproven theory, and scientists, clever as they are, will never find or really understand the answer to everything. The universe is constantly recreating itself by expanding, so their constant learning to understand that process will be a game of constant catch-up with no end. The current view appears to be, ""Let's look for another planet because we've trashed this one."" This film's script is basically destroy the past and live in the future so we have in reality nearly achieved the first part. But will there be a future? Only Science Fiction can do that."
" Something different from Nolan's hand
",HafizhMaulana21,9,6 January 2023,"A Protagonist undergoes a complicated mission by saving the world from future time attacks that can change the survival of the entire world.It wouldn't be Christopher Nolan if it didn't make the audience confused and think hard about watching the film. Tenet is such a complicated science fiction movie. Too mathematical. Nolan was inspired by the story of quantum physics. This is what makes it difficult for ordinary people to understand. Many of my own word terms are also not used to being heard. Some of the scientific concepts that run in this movie I also never heard of. As a result, many people have difficulty in understanding this movie and it is difficult to digest every scene. The film seems to have been made for scientists.Tenet has a complex and interconnected storyline. Using a story related to the existence of a time war that takes place in the future is unique to this film. The back-and-forth plot will always be Nolan's trademark, including this film which also makes us have to repeat some of the scenes in this movie. Tenet has such a fast pace of the film that it makes the film even harder to understand. Given the use of the term science in his dialogue. Some scenes also seem to be to the point in providing explanations. There are also some scenes that are seen in the cut, giving rise to plot holes in the story.This film is interesting, it's just that it sees some cases where the story is still hollow, scenes that don't look perfect are weaknesses in this film. Likewise, the messy audio effect is an oddity in itself in my opinion in Nolan's own track record. Between the voices of the actors and the background music overlap each other. Especially when the scene of wearing a mask is really not clearly heard what they say. For his acting, both John David Washington and Robert Pattinson are excellent. Overall, the film is very good and a masterpiece. If you really understand."
" A mess
",alexandramkeene,6,6 January 2023,"I'm sure this was a good movie, but i wasn't taking notes (because i was watching a movie) so i couldn't keep up. Good performances across the board and Nolan movies are always stylistically impressive but the plot was so complicated and scattered. If you're going to see this, get some spoilers so you can wrap your head around it and you won't spend the whole movie trying to chart out what's going on. It's like Inception on steroids mixed with a sci fi James Bond. Good concept, but it's too all over the place for a one-time viewer. When it was over all I could say was ""what just happened?????"""
" What's the opposite of Suspense and Action?
",bbwwmcmc,4,26 December 2022,"Oh yeah, boredom and tediousness. So in that sense, mission accomplished.Perhaps for future films the crypto Nolan can focus a bit less on the overtly stagey prescience and share more than the visual creep of Bane's mask that so weirdly and coincidentally resonates in today's social dystopia (what is it with breathing masks in his movies like ALL of the Tom Hardy characters?).Give us a real peek of the secret societies instead for a change, if you dare Christopher.Sure, he's no Kubrick and it shows, no reverse gear needed there. 'Too Clever by Half' in Nolan's case becomes 'Too Clever by a Millionth' with all its accompany devaluation.Palindromically, a more suitable title for the movie would have been, 'Dud'.Save yourself at least 2 and a half hours in this dimension, perhaps more if you then skip the parallel ones you may reside in, and take a hard pass.Time will then be on your side."
" A challenging masterpiece.
",fb6ins1z1,9,25 December 2022,"They say imagination - not knowledge - is the true sign of intelligence. Well, Christopher Nolan must be quite the genius. The premise on which the plot of this movie is based is something many people don't even know about in its theoretic form. Yet Nolan dared to write it into a story, imagined and visualized, and present it in a fairly digestible manner despite the inherent risk of goofs and continuity errors in such a production. All of that requires imagination far beyond the average person possesses.Tenet is certainly not meant to be enjoyed by everybody. First of all, in order to make the most of this experience, the viewer needs to have at least the simplest understanding of entropy and the non-linearity of space and time. While Tenet presents to us in the opening minutes the phenomena and how they apply to the plot, it may all seem like complete fiction if the viewer has no prior knowledge of the fact that ""reverse entropy"" is actually possible due to nothing in the math that explains our physical universe suggesting otherwise.Tenet has a familiar feel, akin to Memento and Inception, both of which are also directed and written by Nolan. However, in terms of concessions made for allowing the plot to be more accessible to the average viewer, Tenet may well represent the epitome of Nolan's approach that I suspect aims to isolate the intelligent from the average. The viewer is never spoon-fed throughout this experience. The dialogue is concise and wastes no time in delivering critical information. There are practically no greetings; every conversation sprints straight to the point, and missing as little as 15 seconds of it can mean the subsequent chapter will make much less sense. What Nolan asks of the viewer for the best experience is not only some prior knowledge on the physics but also undivided attention.Tenet is certainly challenging to watch, especially if you feel lost along the way. Could it have been made more accessible? Yes, I think so, but I don't know at what cost. The aforementioned concise dialogue and the cold, quiet professionalism of the main characters are essential ingredients in setting the tone here. Also, by the induced difficulty to follow the plot at times, the viewer is ushered into realizing how advanced our minds would have to be in order to understand the theory behind such complex physics, let alone develop technology to harness its potential. It deliberately intimidates us.This movie is difficult to rate because it is unique - despite having similarities with Nolan's other products. I think the only detractor can be its lack of accessibility, but I also believe that is one of its key features. In terms of imagination and creativity, films like this are hard to come by. I understand why many reviewers underrated Tenet, but it is actually a masterpiece that was just waiting for the right mind(s) to come along and film it."
" Fennel
",simmans,4,23 December 2022,"I watched Tenet...And then, finally, I watched Tenet with subtitles, because it's on Netflix, thinking I would enjoy it more...I did not.Sure, I had better access to the exposition, which is fine, but the grander plot was no more sensible than when I first watched, Sam's subtitles.In brief, Tenet is far less clever than it imagines itself.Time travel is complicated, certainly, proven by the fact that we haven't yet accomplished it. The best time travel movies establish their loose rules, then dance to Chuck Berry tunes, because time travel logic can never adhere to itself. Back To The Future and Avengers: Endgame succeed despite their failures. That is, ""Let's get on with the rest of the plot, because this time travel thing is never going to stand up to scrutiny.""Tenet is a film that has no other plot to move on to, because it is entirely concerned with making its non-logic logical.I imagine that writer-director Christopher Nolan lost precious sleep because he convinced himself that he could concoct a perfect time travel MacGuffin... but in doing so he sacrificed any kind of narrative that the audience could invest itself in.Marty McFly saves his family. Tony Stark gets the Infinity Stones and palavers with his dad. Sarah Connor goes to the playground... these popcorn moments don't exist in Tenet.Nolan has inserted his head so far up his own bottom, trying to concoct a logical time travel narrative, that he forgot to include a fun adventure.His greatest failing, however, is that his time travel dynamics don't stand up to scrutiny... and the dull mess he's left behind make even less sense than when Marty McFly woke up to a family of happy, succesful siblings.I mean... did some contractor actually build Freeport facilities using pre-shot glass?"
" Unrealized masterpiece
",sajjadgarshasbi-1995,10,20 December 2022,"Tenet is an exciting movie with great content.This is not an opinion based on feelings, but I came to this conclusion after carefully reviewing the film.About the visual effects of the film, I have to say that you are greeted with a beautiful painting in all the sequences.Nolan has captured amazing images by choosing the best locations around the world.The music of the film serves the narration of the story and keeps the heart rate of the audience high.In the sequences where time is reversed, everything is executed perfectly and there are no technical flaws.He warns us about the third world war. The atmosphere of the film is designed in such a way that the audience feels a strange and real fear of a possible war. And this is a masterpiece in every sense.The complexity of the story is sweet and pleasant and does not go beyond the limit to be a source of torment for the audience.Don't get involved in finding scientific answers to the presented topics and just feel them.Then you will understand that Nolan warned us in simple language that if we use the resources of the world in the same way, it is possible that the next generations will find the intention to go back to the past and destroy us after the invention of the time machine.This is a general analysis of Nolan's film.The chase sequences are also made as beautifully as possible.Philosophically, Nolan has spoken a lot in the form of symbols and playing with words and sentences through the dialogues exchanged between the actors."
" Nolan shows us again he is a skillful visionary
",mabmadridespana,10,17 December 2022,"This film arrives at the rare achievement of being able to make present and future match in a perfectly logical palindrome. There is an ambitious premise behind each detail of the script: to balance two opposite views of time, onwards and backwards, our actual time and space and a utopian one, and take us to the middle of this balance.Its score, under the supervision of an emerging genius such as Ludwig Goransson, makes a perfect match for the intensity demanded by the complex montage. Visuals are strikingly original, and it all sums up to set a notion of timelessness in such a critical context us this days we are living in..."
" Clever, clever but not smart.
",lastminutemike,3,16 December 2022,"To make a name for learning when other ways are barred, take something very simple and make it very hard. Piet Hein wrote that.Nolan is trying too hard. When you unweave the story from its telling it's not very interesting, and that is disguised but not improved by the way it is told. I'm sure it all looked good on paper and the backwards forwards stuff made sense in diagrammatic form but as a film it just went sideways into the territory of ""who cares"". The emotional content was sketched in rather than developedThere have been several films, including Following and Memento, where a simple story has been made more enthralling by telling it in a complex fashion. This was not one of them."
" Who green-lighted this movie?
",mrkcase,3,13 December 2022,"When you walk out of a movie and have no idea what's it's about..then it's a bad movie. Forget about the dialog. You won't be able to hear it and none of it matters anyway. Who are all the characters? You'll never know and I doubt you'll even remember their names while taking the post movie bathroom visit. Hopefully Nolan can chill out with his obsession with time. It's worked in other movies but I started getting nervous with the jumbled up timelines in Dunkirk. To me, this movie is unwatchable. Go watch ""Primer"" instead. A great indie time travel movie.I need to put extra characters to post this."
" Tries too hard to be complex
",ullasharma-95619,7,12 December 2022,"I really like Nolan's movies. All of them have been astoundingly good.I like the way he plays with timelines and also I like to come with my own analysis.But with Tenet , it seems like Nolan has deliberately tried to over-complicate a simple (compared to his other) story line.Ofcourse , by intentionally leaving several scenes open-ended + playing around the editing , he has managed to confuse his audience.Perhaps this indeed was his goal and not really to make his ideas clear.Nolan fans will tend to try 'understanding' this story and interpret in their own ways , in an attempt to prove their own intelligence.But story isnt as complicated , as i understand.Here is what I Understood :
All major powers have already discovered the ways of time travel , which they call 'turnstiles'.The inverse technology is already well known and used by Super-Secret government organizations.This screws up the future generations , and they try to find a way to find objects and humans who have been 'inversed'.A scientist discovers a program named 'Tenet' , which basically when activated searches and destroys all 'inversed objects'.Government agencies in future and past , realizing the danger of this program - hunt the scientist and and she breaks the program down
into 9 pieces and hides them.The government agencies then hire protagonist in the past to track and find the program.Meanwhile , rebels in future - who want the problematic future to end for good , recruit Antagonist (Andrei) to collect all pieces of program and execute it.But protagonist , knowing Governments true intentions , has his own plans.The protagonist manages to find the program before it gets executed , takes it apart into three pieces.Result : The timeline is undisturbed , Governments continue to use timemachines and future is doomed.Other characters are introduced intentionally by Nolan to muddle things."
" Very Good
",rabeaaron,8,2 December 2022,"Nolan never ceases to amaze as he finds a new way of creating a movie around time. Unfortunately, this film stands out more as an impressive technical achievement than a gripping story you truly care about. Tenet's world gets lost in the weeds and lacks the character development to place this film in the top-tier category like many of Nolan's previous films. This film is worth a watch but will not be remembered as Nolan's best work.Plot: 9/10
Acting: 7/10
Cinematography: 6/7
Score: 3.5/5

" Thinking hard or hardly thinking?
",phlame64,6,2 December 2022,"It's innovative, but that's all there is to it. Nolan wanted to surprise the audience and appeal to intelligent people, but the plot ends up being all familiar from hundreds of other action/thriller films. The special effects were fantastic and a total waste of money, as usual with Hollywood movies. The backward scenes could have probably been done better. It's one of those films that you're supposed to watch twice or three times to fully comprehend. If only the prospect of seeing it again was more appealing, that is. I'm sure there's a lot of scientific nonsense, speculation, and errors, too. As is typical of Nolan films, he takes unconfirmed scientific theories (mostly from physics) for granted, adds a few paradoxes, guns, explosions, and attractive women, and makes billions. Dialogues were rather shallow, with a few highly technical terms thrown in here and there to make them sound deep. I watched it only to understand what people were talking about, but won't watch it again and won't recommend watching it."
" A chaotic mess, I love it!
",sionetupou-25970,9,29 November 2022,"I love the concept, I love the visuals and I love the way it all ties up in the end. Granted this movie will be difficult to enjoy if you try too hard to understand it, just take notice of what happens and see it through. A second watch through wouldn't hurt either. Moving, fighting and shooting in reverse is crazy, even to come up with the idea as Christopher Nolan pulls off.Granted as I mentioned thinking too hard wod negate ones enjoyment. Not to mention the main character feels flat for me. Witty and competent, just flat in terms of natural charisma.Overall a good watch if you got the time to pay attention."
" Like the movie or not, Tenet is a groundbreaking cinematic achievment
",manshowerdan,8,23 November 2022,"The time reversal scenes, the fight scene, and the way Nolan was able to capture scenes that were almost completely reversed accept the character. These alone are truly amazing accomplishments but I also think the rest of the movie is better than some people give it credit for. It is a bit confusing but personally I like to think out movies and this is probably the most timey wimey movie i've ever watched. I really do think that some people don't understand it and are thinking of things too linear which are some of the super negative reviews.The movie is clearly very well thought out and accomplishes establishing a lot of revolutionary film making techniques and ideas."
" You were just watching it for the cool visuals, be honest you had no clue what was going on
",charlesdavidson-54251,2,21 November 2022,"I remember watching this for the first time after hearing great things, but I was I left completely confused and not wanting answers.The main character is so boring, he didn't have a single defining trait. A plot is cool on paper but the storytelling is just so dumb. The whole time travel thing is not explained well in the slightest, now I'm not expecting a top of the class science graduate level explanation but just something would be nice. The pacing is broken, all throughout the film I was constantly asking, why are we were, why are we doing this.By the time we get to the final act there are so many characters and people that we don't know. I'll give it this though, the whole effect of running through a city while it's being destroyed in reverse (yes, that is real) looks really dope, in fact most of the film looks really good. But when you're constantly asking why to everything, it really takes away from what would have been a really cool scene.The villain wasn't anything special and I'm constantly internally screaming ""HE'S RIGHT THERE"" and the excuse they give is so stupid 'we need him alive for information', like what information. It's so stupid especially since he's killed later in the film anyway so wtf. And the final twist was dumb and didn't need to be in the filmOverall, I'm sure this film has it's fans but I'm not one of them. The plot and story is so confusing that it effectively ruins what what have been cool scenes. The characters are dull and didn't leave an impression on me. I have heard this is a film I need to watch multiple times but this isn't one I plan on revisiting."
" #Masterful_movie
",Mehul-Parkhiya,10,19 November 2022,"TENETWatching this movie was the best movie experience I have ever had and you should definitely go and experience it too.It had great acting, story, cinematography, music and dialogue. The concept of inversion was worked out perfectly, just like you're used to from Nolan. Sure, it was complicated but if you pay attention it is really never incomprehensible. Because of the concept of inversion you'll set your eyes on things you have never seen before in any movie or series.That is also one of the many aspects that make Tenet a very special movie and a real experience, and an experience you will definitely want to experience again. In my opinion, if you loved other Nolan movies like Inception, Interstellar, Memento and The Prestige you will undoubtedly absolutely love Tenet too.Christopher Nolan? The man who keeps delivering.. I feel so stupid after seeing his movies the first time, but yet I'm still so impressed. He makes a movie, which I love, but not quite understand completely. I can't stop thinking about it and after some hours, I slowly start to make sense.Tenet was terrific, even tho my brain felt blended."
" Ignore all the 1 star troll review
",jedkonmars,7,12 November 2022,"A miracle happened yesterday I went to the cinema again and watching this film makes me so great to be back in.Tenet (2020) is a recently released spy thriller directed Christopher Nolan who's known for directing films like Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014) and The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005-2012), this film was supposed to come out in July but then a certain something happened so it got pushed back to August.The plot revolves around 2 spies on a mission to prevent World War 3 which instead of nuclear weapons will be caused by a bullet that will reverse time.As the first film I've seen at the cinema after a long time, It was a really good film, the acting was really good, the action scenes were well choreographed, I love the way they shot the film and as a replacement for Han Zimmer Ludwig Goransson brings us a fantastic score.However the movie can be confusing at some scenes especially the bits when they go back in time.But all in all this movie was a really good spy thriller and is definitely worth a ticket to see."
" Ummmmmm WHAT DID I JUST WATCH ??
",ezyja,5,11 November 2022,"Seriously I like Nolan and am a fan of the cast, but WTF is this movie ?It starts at the end, or beginning or whatever he's trying to pitch here, the score is so pulsating and so loud the audio is muffled out and then he adds the fact we can travel in reverse while travelling forwards in the same situation using a pincer object.......not making sense.....HA wait til u see this and just try making sense of it.Nolan is too smart for his own britches in this epic and hopefully he returns to simplistic viewing of memento......that's right I said it, Memento was simplistic compared to this attempt at a pleasurable experience.It's hard to watch and hard to understand and takes effort viewing (which ull have to do multiple times to make any sense) even just the once."
" Please rewind the tape
",vhtfykyys,4,9 November 2022,"Back in the 70s when we were kids in school the teacher would occasionally show us educational films on a reel to reel projector. Even more occasionally she would accidentally queue the spool the wrong way, or at then end of the movie we'd plea with her to keep the projector on while she respooled the film back to the original reel. We found it hilarious to see water flow back into cups, people walk backwards, balls bounce into hands... Later in the 80s we'd sometimes do the same with rented films, preparing them for return, though it was no longer so uncanny and amazing. In the 90s music video directors would get singers to learn their words backwards so they could reverse the film for effect. It was cool at first but became a fairly obvious trope. With digital film and personal computers making reverse play easy there is no novelty in doing so.Tenet seems to exist purely because you can rewind recorded film. Maybe if it came out in 1978 minds would have blown. Today the conceit is so obvious it is impossible to enjoy naively, constantly calling attention to the fact that we are watching a movie. The final battle scenes hilariously expose the poor ability of extras to walk backwards as if they are walking forwards. I found it impossible to ever suspend disbelief.Perhaps it wouldn't matter if the script was any good, or the acting brilliant. But dialogue is terrible, wooden, first draft poor. The story makes no sense. It is all entirely bad. Nolan I want my time back. Rewind pls."
" You need to understand it, to appreciate it.
",muskad202-804-796887,8,5 November 2022,"A very different take on time-travel.You need to understand it, to appreciate it.To understand it, I had to watch it twice.I wouldn't mind watching it once more.As expected, most audiences found it difficult to understand, and thus appreciate. And most wont have the patience (and rightly so, this shouldn't be a requirement) to watch it more than once.Nevertheless, its great that we have someone like Christopher Nolan who can churn out mentally stimulating movies like Inception and Tenet.Subtitles would have been great, and were very much needed in the scenes where the characters are talking through their gas masks."
" Two genres squished into one that make it very challenging to understand
",jordyntsmith,7,2 November 2022,"A spy thriller where the main character is trying to stop the unraveling of all humanity against an enemy who can move through time.The concept of the movie is interesting. I would have liked a deeper exploration of moving backward through time. Unfortunately, the movie becomes very difficult to follow due to the whole spy plot. If the movie had explored the whole time element through a different genre, one where the motives and intentions of the characters are not intentionally hidden, then I think his could have been great.It's a very dense movie that is hard the follow. The visuals are quite good though, and the actors are all excellent. It's not for everyone, but those who enjoy Nolan's work would probably enjoy it."
" Most Mind Blowing Movie of All Time
",hnambiar,10,1 November 2022,"Tenet is one of those movies where with every rewatch of the movie, you appreciate it even more.As a Cristopher Nolan fan, I thoroughly enjoyed every single bit of the movie, everything from the idea, acting, storylines, set pieces and implementation. Every single thing is done to perfection.WARNING: If you do not like to rewatch movies and have to think deeply about the movie, then this movie is not for you.Tenet is a cinematic masterpiece with its unique idea, set pieces and motifs.I know many people did not understand it even after rewatching it. I understood it the first time I saw it, rewatched it the next day and appreciated it even more.Nolan: Yes
Me: How much should I blow your mind?"
" Tenet is a masterpiece
",lukekspivey,10,31 October 2022,"There are a few legitimate complaints about this movie, but people who don't like it seem to focus their reviews on things that aren't even true. Tenet can be difficult to follow if you have to be spoon-fed dialogue, if most other time travel movies hurt your head, or if you don't understand the concept of entropy even after googling it. If you meet those requirements Tenet should score at least an 8/10 for you with its easy-to-appreciate aspects. These come in the form of great acting, the score, well-choreographed fights despite its sci-fi focus, and witty humor that doesn't slow down the incredible pace. I'm happy that people can watch this movie and enjoy it, but what is disappointing to me is the inability of people to put effort into the films they are watching. Tenet, like other Nolan films, will reward you immensely for putting forth some time and thought. I have seen many reviews listing issues with the movie that simply do not exist. To avoid spoilers, I will not debunk them here but know that you should watch the movie (probably more than once), and only once you fully understand it do you allow yourself to be influenced by the rest of the people here who don't know what's going on. Assuming you watch this in the right mindset and give it a genuine chance, I don't see how this could not become some of anyone's favorite movies.The part above is for people who are deciding whether or not to watch the film. I may later write my thoughts on the movie, but it might be my #1 of all time."
" Headache-inducing, not always in a good way
",massimilianofoschi,7,30 October 2022,"Christopher Nolan is often rightfully appreciated for creating complex movies with skillful exposition such that the audience understands enough to be thrilled, but is still left with the desire to rewatch the flick to comprehend all the intricacies. With Inception and Interstellar, he succeeded admirably. In Tenet, on the other hand, he left a lot to be desired.Tenet's main sin is that the root of the confusion it induces in the viewer is in how the underlying symmetrical harmony of the story is covered by what is essentially smoke. The issue is not a lack of logic, an emotional core or whatever, it's that it struggles to convey the central themes effectively. Nevertheless, if you're willing to the work yourself, there is some reward at the end, so it's generally worth seeing."
" What's with all the bad reviews?
",zachswaze,9,28 October 2022,"This film has honestly become one of my favorite releases over the last couple years. I've watched it at least 4/5 times. Much more that Inception which everyone seems to think was better, but I have to disagree. Are people mad that they actually have to pay attention and think about complex theories? Maybe just stick to the unoriginal time travel movies like The Adam Project or Back to The Futures lol.The concept was very original. Decent twists that play out with the discovery of Neil being recruited by The Protagonist in the future, how he is the one to save him in the beginning of the movie. The tone, cinematography, effects, acting were all great. I would love to see a sequel that explores who invents the inversion technology and the war that insures in the future."
" Terrible audio/soundtrack
",patrick-413,3,26 October 2022,"Sorry, but I hated this movie. It had so much potential: I love the cast, I like the concept, and some of the action scenes are quite good. But aside from the overly complicated plot, which was distracting but not a deal-breaker, I just hated the soundtrack.First, let's just get this out of the way: the music is terrible. It's like the worst of the Tangerine Dream scores from the 70s and 80s on steroids. That style of score ruined so many otherwise good movies from that era that I believe it constitutes a blight on cinema, but this is even worse. Completely obtrusive, overpowering, and unlistenable.And then, to make matters worse, the ""music"" was mixed so high that it constantly overpowered the dialogue. There were several places where I had no idea what people were saying because the score was MUCH louder than the voices.I'll say that the plot, while convoluted and based on ideas that were logically flawed, would probably be better up on a second viewing. But the first viewing was so unpleasant and painful that I'll never give it that second watch that the filmmakers were obviously hoping I'd give it.Three stars only for the good characters and interesting dialogue - what little of it I could hear, that is."
" Confusing boring with obnoxiously loud background noises
",lopezpatricia-06139,1,22 October 2022,This film is an insult to anyone with a basic grasp of physics. Even a physics lecture would be easier to follow than this crap. I had to nurse the Bluetooth speaker in my hand because the dialogue was impossible to hear but any other noises like a gun going off or a car door slamming were absolutely deafening and a complete assault of our senses. As everyone has said it's beyond difficult to follow making it boring boring boring!! I've been a die hard fan of sci fi my whole life but this made no sense at all. If it had been 2 hours or less I'd have seen it through but the last 25 mins we just cut our losses and shut it down like a roach infested cafe. Oh and check out when one guy described the grandfather paradox saying there is no right answer. What utter nonsense.
" God, this movie is really dumb and badly made
",flingebunt,3,21 October 2022,"It starts with the possibility of an interesting twist on time travel. But the plot only moves forward through people sit around talking. Meanwhile there is all this action padding out the run time. The action is basically a really dumb spy thriller.Then it ends up as a conventional time travel story. What is worse, the effects are boring, the logic doesn't make much sense, the plot is poorly executed.This is Peak Christopher Nolan, in that he loves to play around with time and times lines in his movies, but proves he is not up to the task. It only appears to be a smart movie to dumb people. Give this one a miss."
" Fascinating. Magical. Engaging screenplay
",tejassawant13,9,20 October 2022,"A bit of confusing yet engaging story. Nolan Sir's direction and Screenplay is super tight. I loved all characters. Protagonist and Neil, both characters were well written.Story of the movie is a bit confusing, and its good attempt because story is meant to confuse the audience. All the 3 acts in the movie are like climax in a way. And the reason behind it is the Direction of the movie.The film demands attention and careful observation at camera work, dialogues, etc.Cinematography is good. Especially camera work.Special appreciation for Background score. Background score is the heart of the movie. So engaging. Hats off. It has power to give you at edge of the seat on lots of scenes.Film has some negative points, such as it is not a popcorn enjoy movie. It demands your attention. Yeah!Must Watch for sure."
" The most intelligent sci-fi in decades
",michaelkostukov,9,18 October 2022,"You will likely not enjoy the movie if you do not enjoy mind-bending puzzles. The movie is almost impossible to understand on the first watching. In the world of simplistic Marvel style superhero movies where the average movie goers' attention span is less than a minute- this movie will confuse a lot of people from the get go. They will inevitably project their frustration into negative ratings and complains of ""poor writing"". It requires at least two or three watchings to fully appreciate how good the writing actually is, the amazing attention to details and how everything actually makes sense - contrary to the initial perception."
" Enjoyable if you don't think about it
",tesmond,6,17 October 2022,"The film was fun and interesting, but not if you start thinking about it.One of the great aspects of Nolan films is afterwards you want to go away and discuss them and think about the concepts and the story points that occur. This film is no exception.Much like his other films it has an interesting concept that makes you want to delve into more and really think about it. This is sadly the point that everything falls apart. As soon as you start thinking about character motivations, the flow off the story and alternative choices you start to realise that the whole thing kind of falls apart.I cannot actively recommend it but some of the concepts are interesting enough that it is more than just watchable. However, it does feel a little like the set pieces were written before the entire plot and the plot was really there to force the set pieces into play."
" Garbage
",salmar-26419,1,17 October 2022,"This movie is total garbage. The acting is stiff and cardboard, like everyone is reading off a piece of paper. The score is a total assault on the senses as is the whole movie. I feel that the positive reviews are from pretentious people who found the movie so bad that they think they must have missed something, so they give it a positive review to not appear ignorant. I don't mean to insult anyone, but I just don't understand how anyone found anything to like about this movie. This wants to be an intelligent movie, but it just isn't. I don't leave a lot of reviews, but this movie is just so bad that I had to write this to justify the time wasted watching it."
" Over complex! but had potential!
",curtistyrell,5,16 October 2022,"If only they simplified how time and objects were shifted. They could have atleast done a more simiplified presentation of the technoglogy or the scientific reasons behind it. It would have been so much more easier to follow if they'd done this. Cause I mean the film wasnt terrible, It just felt like the writer tried way too hard to make things sound complex and interesting when in the end it didnt really make sense at all.I've watched this movie twice now and still struggled on the second viewing. Though the second time was much easier than the first since I already had a rough idea what was happening. I also had to watch it with subtitles since the audio muffled and dialogue is very hard to catch in parts. Some parts the dialogue just sounds like the actors are straight mumbling.Considering the movie was written and directed by Christipher Nolan, you could say it was a bad movie. That's comparing to his other works. It definitely had potential, and I could have seen this as a good sequel, but only if the story or dialogue was more simplied or they presented what was happening more thoroughly, the dialogue was clear and didnt need sub titles, and the characters were believeable.Overall. Not a bad movie, not a good movie. Had potential."
" Boring Bond rip off
",mcoats-71101,3,14 October 2022,"Not sure how this film got such a high rating, people will think anything is good these days!It starts off well, but soon descends into what all these Bond-like films tend to, quickfire scenes that don't necessarily tie together, a few explosions, overly sped up repartee between multiple characters who always know a little too much about every subject in the world, and of course an English thesp playing an over the top Russian baddy. Yawn. Sure there are some great locations shot in but then you'd expect that in a Bond-esque rip off. Oh and chuck in Michael Caine for a cameo because you know he's British.I don't buy Washington in the main role, nepotism aside, he's too small and awkward to be ""the protagonist"". He's too stiff, delivers his obvious one liners terribly ""at least buy me dinner first"" when being frisked and he and Pattison look like they'd struggle to run a 5k challenge let alone take on and beat up multiple burly Russians.The plot too is just trying to be complex for the same of it, like a mix between Inception and Bourne - this fails on multiple levels. It's lazy, overacted, trite and quite frankly incredibly dull."
" Great..... but Mumble mumble
",ijiqkwfv,6,14 October 2022,"This film would have been a 9 for me. It's extremely complex but I enjoy understanding more of the plot on each rewatch. It is clearly intended to be both immersive and thought provoking and certainly succeeds on many levels. I also thought some of the performances were excellent, particularly the ""baddie"" who I would not want to meet.But sad to say the sound has ruined it for me. With a plot this complex the viewer feels compelled to grasp every word being spoken and with Tenet this proved impossible. Some scenes I watched 5 times in quick succession but were just an incomprehensible mumble to me, particularly from the main character. Having to turn on the subtitles to get key plot points is a real turn off.What a shame."
" Low IQ People Are Hilarious...This Film Needs A Re-Release
",bowen101-160-829536,10,11 October 2022,"Gotta love the hilarity of people with the IQs of potatoes crying and whining about ""pretentious"" and ""boring"". They just want a ""good guy get hot girl and shoot bad guy in face and save day"" for their plots. If it were left up to these cave-crawling, likely gun-toting no-IQ hick degenerates, cinema would have no depth, and everything would be explained to them using no more than 5 letter words written in crayon. Go watch all the Fast movies (no offense) or Marvel if you want low-effort entertainment for the rest of your life. Some of us like to use our brains. What a joke. Imagine admitting to having the intellectual range of a fruit fly and then blaming other people for you being confused. Get gud you insufferable numbnuts.Most of the negative reviews complain about the film simply having depth and a plot line that isn't laid out for you in the first 5 minutes. This movie breaks the mold of no effort storytelling and weaves together a plot with tons of moving parts that fit together seamlessly. I will say the sound mixing was indeed odd at points where there was dialogue, and several scenes were tough to understand what people were saying. Be sure to watch with subtitles to get everything, but it's not necessary to enjoy the film. It's a wild and very satisfying ride."
" A mess
",amanfra-95901,6,10 October 2022,I love Nolan films. Even when they don't make much sense such as Interstellar. What frustrates me about this film is that the dialog is truly well-written but we can't even hear it over the annoying endless violins that sound like the giant speaker in Back to the Future. Like goodness. I'm trying to understand a complicated fictional story so that I can understand why half the film is played in reverse lol. I've watched it three times and still can't hear it three times. The other problem is terrible scene transitions. Like walking to motor boating (giggity) to sail boating to balcony jumping to dinner to sitting on a couch to whispering to yelling to forwarding to backwarding. LOL I've never needed to take a nap after a movie so much than after the incredibly exhausting Tenet.
" A movie that had to be seen twice to be exelent
",maxpinzonestrada,10,8 October 2022,"The first time you watch it you keep with the freaking that it was too long and that it was too complicated, BUT the second time you watch it you understand it and you understand why EACH SINGLE FRAME , not more or less, was important and needed for this movie to be exelent. Defenetly one of my favorite movies of all time when you start to think about it, because it's not a movie that just tells you what is happening, you see what is happening and understand it right in that moment you see it and that's what is perfect. Also things that happen, and you don't understand it, but it gets explained at the very end because it's a time traveling movie and it just makes sense to explain things when they are happening in the right timeline and not in the reversed because that would take the tension effect away. The movie and the Musik are perfectly made and interact perfect with each other. A A literal masterpiece.10/10."
" mumbo jumbo
",williams-14,3,7 October 2022,"Honestly, this is nonsense designed to make stupid people feel cleverand frankly, given the 7.3 rating ... it worked.I didn't enjoy it. It didn't make sense. It's noise, soundbites, explosions. There's really not much more to it. Lots of music, chases, a tall woman playing exactly the same role she played in The Night Manager.This is an empty vacuous piece of flash trash for a generations whose attention span is too short to tell a coherent story from a training montage. It's what the 20s deserve.I'm just astonished / saddened that this is considered top class film making. It's glitter and smoke bombs."
" Chis Nolan bomb
",paah1944,1,3 October 2022,Have been a Chris Nolan fan big time since watching/ following the Batman trilogy What an effort. Best Batman actor. Best bad guy actor an Aussie In receipt of an Oscar posthumous. Best support actors Gary Oldman a gem. That's two poms Bale & Oldman plus Nolan the pom. Batman not overly complicated or drawn out with monster action pieces. Good story and viewer friendly memorable. This being the main reason I decided to watch Tenet a pommie effort which usually/mostly succeeds. Wrong from the outset sports arena terrorist attack it was foggy complicated all over the shop made no sense blurred vacant rudderless whottha?. A female enters and mumbles alot. The Sci fi where are we really stuff gave me a headache. The lead actor looked like he regretted signing on and bored. Forty five minutes into it I bailed. Maybe Nolan has followed the Cohen brothers to a hole in the ground?Patrick.
" Hands down. Boundaries of cinema is pushed.
",anil_pattanaik,9,2 October 2022,"Excellent movie, it is definitely difficult to understand in first watch, but that's the style. We go to movie theatre to watch something which will blow our mind, so TENET is the best example. You will be astonished how Christopher Nolan is raising his bars for himself in movie making from ""Following"" to ""Tenet"".The whole movie is difficult as it was difficult to digest ""Time Travelling"" in early 80's. You will love the movie if you can think everything in non-linear ways ;)Look, don't get in the theatre if you can't stop thinking in linear terms :) - reference from the movie as told by Aaron Taylor-Johnson."
" Overwrites Itself
",oliviaburgin17,1,2 October 2022,"This film tangles itself up in its own narrative. We have allowed Nolan too much power, and he's collapsed in on himself in a black hole of nonsense.The logic doesn't hold up, the characters are emotionless and the sound design is atrocious. This film has Nolan's trademark coldness, to its absolute detriment. It lacks any emotional depth and any narrative coherence, losing itself in its own justification and washing up on its own mediocrity with nothing to protect itself with.Also, write women better. He needs to write better women. This film was so boring because it was just men fighting men about nothing, and it's the same men as in all his other films. Something new please Nolan!"
" Very confusing !!
",bfsr81,2,26 September 2022,"I enjoyed most of Nolan's movies. Those dealing with different time lines such as Inception, memento or Interstellar where one of the best Science Fiction movies in 2000s as they were very enjoyable and understandable.Unlike previous mentioned movies, this movie is very difficult to follow, the characters are not likable, and even music is not enjoyable. Movie duration becomes excessive under such circumstances where you can't follow anything.As for the male protagonists, I do not get engaged with them, the performance wasn't good in my opinion, not because of the acting but because of poor writing. In this movie the main character has no tights with no one. No daughters on earth, no beloved ones, no confusion, no twists ...etc. It is very difficult to understand what drives him. It felt like watching a robot !!Occasionally, I rewatch movies where I feel unfair about my judgement. But frankly Speaking, the simple thought of possibly rewatching it gives me a headache.I am not sure If Nolan is trying to outsmart us!! Or making us feel like we are intellectually not good enough to understand his work!! It is very confusing ... Probably he needs to rethink again if he correctly passed the narrative and story. I personally think, he failed this time."
" A little too much
",jesseen,7,26 September 2022,"After proving his absolute loyalty in the field, a CIA operative is entrusted with a mission of the highest secrecy: investigating a new physics-defting technology of entropic reversal. His mission pits him against a ruthless Russian arms dealer, whose wife he comes to pity. Can he discover the true nature of his assignment and save everyone he cares for?If I understand right (which I'm not sure I do), the core mechanism is basically time travel with the gimmick that when you're in the past, things around you move in reverse. And there's no problem with encountering a former version of yourself as long as you don't touch. I suspect the mechanism would break down under close scrutiny.I think Nolan has hit a tipping point re: the wackiness/complexity of his plots. Inception was wacky, but comprehensible, and very enjoyable. Interstellar was wacky and less comprehensible, but still very enjoyable. But Tenet is so wacky and incomprehensible, the inscrutability harms the enjoyability. I expect he will course-correct after hitting this threshold."
" Unintelligible
",northernpaladin,4,25 September 2022,"I love Christopher Nolans work and see him as one of the outstanding directorial talents of the C21st but this is woeful and after the boring Dunkirk and the fairly average Interstellar one could think he is losing his edge. Some reviews on here have tried to claim that if you don't understand/like the film you are some kind of intellectual pigmy, not only is that clearly insulting it is also wrong headed, it is the director's job to provide us with a narrative that makes sense within the world he has created and offer us characters we can identify enough with to be able to enjoy the journey. In this offering we have story which is completely unfathomable and at times quite stupid that at no time do we really know what is going on or why and by the end we don't know how we got there or whether it was worth it. If we take a similar complex and off kilter offering from Nolan like Inception (or for that matter The Prestige) the plotting logic is clear throughout and although we know it could never be real we accept it because it feels real in the world Nolan has created. Such is not the case with Tenet and although that is largely due to the lack of clarity it is also to do with the performances, Washington is simply not cut out to carry the weight of such a dense movie and spends most of the time looking as confused as we are, Debicki is forgettable and Branagh is dumped with a cardboard cut out Russian oligarch he can do little with, the only bright spot is Pattinson who breezes through the whole thing as if he completely understands everything. Now Nolan has also become known for his spectacular set pieces which punctuate the narrative at the right moment and drive the plot forward, not so here, we have three set pieces, the opera house, the airport and the hidden base, but none of them serve any real purpose other just being big set pieces, this something I'd expect the Russo brothers to do not Christopher Nolan. All in all a disappointing watch and I hope Nolan gets back on track although whether a bio pic is the answer I'm not sure."
" Director Christophen Nolan finally got me this time...
",gabryant,5,24 September 2022,"For the most part, I have enjoyed Nolan''s films, even though his tendency to exposition as people are running and jumping, necessitating me to rewind and turn on the closed captions. I even wear as a badge of honor that I ""got"" Inception.But Nolan has finally succeeded in confusing me. I'm still trying to figure out what the running backwards stuff signified, other than something about going backwards in time. The final battle scene, though well-staged is a massive exercise in confusing the viewer. Maybe that was Nolan's point.Nolan always has well executed action sequences, prior complaint about exposition included, and Tenet is no exception. I suppose that you could watch this film for it's action sequences. But without an understanding of it's murky plot? The sequences become meaningless.Additionally, character motivations have a largely negative impact upon this film? Sator's (Kenneth Branagh) motivation for what he is doing? Weak. In addition to the apparently continuity error of occurring in the past, while everything in the present is okay? Dunno for certain on that one,But my final analysis on this film is best summed up by Dean Martin, who in a sketch on their old 60's series, said to (Dan) Rowan and (Dick) Martin, ""I lost you at the bakery."" (Google it, can't add the URL.)"
" Confusing but very interesting
",remcoshtc,9,24 September 2022,"The reviews go very different as this movie has plot and screenplay that has to be in your interest. The bad reviews for bad acting is a thing I don't get. The acting was quite good and the plot and confusing scenes are the best points of the movie that shows that time in another way of abuse is something to take serious. Is there a multi universum? Or will a paradox happen? I can say finally a movie that doesn't have a standard ""back-in-time"" personal issue.To fill up the 600 characters ;) I can go on but that would contain spoilers. 1 tip: Watch the movie twice as it can be to confusing the first time."
" Not a great film but definitely an interesting one!
",DaGhoulJones,6,22 September 2022,"Oh Tenet, haha what are we going to do with you. So I've seen this movie twice now, once in theatres and once at home. After a second viewing and studying the hell out of the plot synopsis on Wikipedia I can say that i kind of get this movie now and I can definitely confirm to myself that I enjoyed it but it is not a great film and definitely not for everyone. Tenet is a very flawed but very interesting film that should only be seen by Nolan die hards, the average movie-goer will HATE this movie but I liked it for it's original concept, I just wish the execution could have been a bit better and a bit more accessible. I just don't think a movie should have to make me look things up to understand it while I'm watching it in order to enjoy it. If you thought inception was confusing then stay the hell away from this one."
" Confusing, self indulgent mess.
",Soothin_grain,3,22 September 2022,"Maybe I'm getting old, (I'm retired) but this movie was confusingly silly. Some of photography was great. The story was simply this. A rich powerful man is getting old. He's suffering from the stress regarding his own mortality. So he wants to destroy the world (ala If I cant have it, no one will). The good guys want to stop him. Thats it. That is literally the simple plot.A whole bunch of unnecessary scenes that are edited in a confusing way to trick the audience into thinking its smarter than it actually is. Also the audio was really weird. The audience cant hear the dialog over the weird music."
" Great looking and wonderfully acted.
",amesmonde,N/A,20 September 2022,"A CIA agent must manipulate the flow of time to prevent an attack from the future that threatens to annihilate the present world.Director writer Christopher Nolan delivers a visually crisp film, with some spectacular setups. It's entertaining and cerebral, but convoluted in places. It's not a time travel film per-say, more time inversion and temporal paradoxes. The film's cinematography, score, editing, acting and costumes are high quality. It's straight laced, haunting and mesmerising, with echoes of the best of James Bond vibe throughout.The supporting cast are first rate, leads Washington and Pattinson are outstanding in this backwards-moving, non-linear thinking offering. Branagh's original bad guy is an interesting dysfunctional addition.Overall, it's grounded sci-fi; quite a simple story, even if a little confusing on the surface. Worth watch for the performances alone."
" An incoherent mess from start to finish
",amontague-45142,3,19 September 2022,"This film is nonsense. The concept throws up so many pseudoscientific concepts any of which aren't even close to interesting. The combination of the forward\reverse action isn't compelling to watch and the story doesn't hold together. Worse stil wastes a talented cast with babbling lines of dialogue that feel like they were fished at random from a hat. The motivation of the antagonist is simply not compelling enough to explain the huge amount of effort he puts into achieving his goals and the brutality he seems to display boils down to him being Russian, one of the few nations stil allowed to be broadly drawn psychopathic villains simply because of where they are from. It's lazy and feels cheap. Honestly the rating reflects the quality that the technical teams put in to the stunts, camera work and sets. The sound mixing is dreadful and I'm glad I streamed this as I had to rewind more than once to hear dialogue, which is pretty unforgivable and must be have been a nightmare in the cinema.Avoid at all costs, because despite what this film would have you believe, you can't go back..."
" Far too stupid for its own good
",zenmateisshite,3,19 September 2022,"Nolan has proved again that he is a stupid person's idea of a smart person.He takes basic physics natural phenomena and breaks every law this brain could think of. That could be exciting to make as an action sci-fi movie but in his case it isn't.In Inception people can influence other people's decisions using dreams and dreams within dreams (OKAY!). In Interstellar love is used to navigate through a black hole (yes I am not kidding), and in Tenet this ""inversion"" malarkey is used to reverse time.This is yet again a stupid idea that I might have come up with when I was 11. Nolan is a grown man and his ability to convince other grown women and men with his utter nonsensical ideas is stellar. I'll give him that.His movie making abilities on the other hand are really, really, really overrated and it is painful."
" Poor character development and it didn't bring me in.
",David431,4,19 September 2022,"All but one of the characters were one dimensional. The pseudoscience had no whiteboarding, hopefully there will be a directors cut with a lecture and diagrams. As it stands the story is an excuse to have big explosions and car chases, which is a shame because a lot of locations are very scenic.The film feels like it was based on a good hook, then it went through a lot of committee stages to remove anything intelligent so it felt confusing at times, intentionally so. Some parts and scenes were good and others not so, and as a result it felt like the film was from parts, made by separate teams stuck together in the cutting room. Generally suffered from too high a budget and not enough work by a couple of capable, focused writers with the director."
" Beyond the acceptable complexity
",sirieys,5,18 September 2022,"There was always going to be a point from which Nolan would fail to capture and retain the attention of audiences. This is it. It's not a bad movie, the acting is good, even the concept is interesting, but I tried to get into the story and connect all the actions but at one point I just gave up and let go. I am sure others will have had the endurance. There is a bit of Lynch's Mulholland Drive here with the second part providing an opportunity to understand fully what's happening to be fair. Maybe it takes a second viewing but where with Inception or Interstellar (or even Memento) this was an exciting perspective, it feels like burden for this one. There had to be a way to make things more within reach, maybe with a simpler plot around the concept."
" Far too clever for it's own good
",mrglenngrant,4,14 September 2022,"This film was everything I expected. And not in a good way.It's a total brain-ache of a story ... very Nolan-esque you might say. I had to search ""Tenet explained"" after watching it and even after reading numerous articles I'm still not entirely clear what's really going on. Does anyone?For much of the film it plays as a decent Bond style thriller. So far, so enjoyable. One the inversion stuff kicks in it gets really confusing. We see scenes that played out earlier play out again but from people who are travelling backwards in time's perspective. I'm just about able to grasp how there are three - yes, three - Protagonists in the Oslo turnstile scene. The car chase is one that I don't have the energy to try and understand at this point in the evening. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe I'll cut my losses. And don't get me started on the battle with the temporal pincer movement.The acting and locations really elevated the film ... however I've always said that a film where you need to watch it more than once to understand - and/or search for explanations after seeing it - has something really wrong with it. I'd wager that anyone who said this film was understandable on first viewing was a Nolanite and a liar. I've seen some reviews that give this film maximum stars - looking at you Cinemablend - and I think they're deluding themselves and just hitting the Nolan coolaid.It does have some neat and clever time travel elements - don't get me wrong - but the multiple versions of people all co-existing in the same time period with some going backwards and some going forwards and some doing both is just too much and makes the story just to much of a mess to really appreciate. I think if Nolan had dialled things down it would have been a much better film ... but I think that he has such a reputation now that each film has to be more bonkers than the last, unfortunately.39/100."
" Appalling sound recording
",kate-foreman-664-656702,4,14 September 2022,"Why do film makers seem to be obsessed with overly loud backing tracks to movies? They add nothing to the story and don't move the plot along. On the other hand it did mean you heard less of Kenneth Branagh's appalling 'all purpose one note Russian accent' so that's a plus.A promising film spoilt by terrible sound recording: this seems to be more and more common lately. Dialogue was either too quiet or the fx and music (which was completely superfluous anyway) drowned it out. There were three of us watching and we gave up by consensus with an hour left to go. Such a pity as it could have been so much better, hence the low score."
" Hard to make sense
",roxmewild,4,10 September 2022,I think the movie had promise but decided to go down the complex route of revealing the story Right from the start I was unsure what was going on and who was who and what relation they had to one another! This makes for a frustrating movie as you are trying to understand and make sense whilst it continues on and I felt like I was playing catch up the whole time!I have watched this movie twice and still find parts hard to grasp maybe that was the intention of the writer sadly it only made viewing less enjoyable even the fight scenes are a tad lame as in they actually look like no contact is made which makes it appear quite bland. All in all the hype this movie was given I feel stems from a snobbery factor of people not being able to admit it was overly complicated making it hard to follow and enjoy .
" Laughable
",Phillippa_me-me-me,2,10 September 2022,"Oh god, where do I even start? Terrible direction, cliche after cliche, embarrassing dialogues, mostly implausible actions and events - do these people not hire consultants to advise them on certain technical aspects while writing the script/filming?!Not sure why some reviewers are rating it so highly, must be the fast car chase aficionados... In fact, everything is way too fast here, so fast that I often found myself getting lost and not quite comprehending what was being said or how different bits of the story interlocked with each other.It's a shame, because the premise of this film had some potential. But alas, they managed to make a joke of it all. It's pretty bad, I couldn't watch it until the end."
" I'm a die hard nolanite, but I don't think I'll ever watch Tenet again
",fairdraconica,4,10 September 2022,"I have to say that I watch everything Nolan makes. I love his unique vision, and I happily watch and re-watch his films and all existing versions of those films. But Tenet doesn't really feel like his film. In comparison to Nolan's intriguing, interesting villains, Tenet's baddie is a cliched, foaming at the mouth psychopath (admittedly, he becomes more coherent within the last 25 minutes, but it's just too late). The main character is not much better, and I just didn't feel much for him at all. I'm not sure it's because of how he was written or if the actor is to blame. I didn't really connect with the vast majority of other characters either. Surprisingly, Neil, the character played by Pattinson was quite interesting, and it's not what I normally say, because I'm not a fan of the actor at all. Yet, I was impressed that he could work with what he was given in this film and make the best out of it. I have no problem with intricate plots, but this one is just hard to follow. Some scenes are more like Michael Bay's garbage than anything that could ever come from Christopher Nolan. The sound effects are horrid in some scenes. The music is good most of the time, but the heavily auto-tuned abomination of a song in the final titles made me roll my eyes. Some people (probably related to the production or distribution this film, one way or another) say that you have to watch Tenet more than once to really get into it, but I just don't want to, and to me it feels like an attempt to make more money. I really don't know what's happened to the film industry of the last few years, but it feels as if all talent is rapidly going out the window."
" Complex Cinematography
",The-Silver-Shadow,10,8 September 2022,"Tenet goes above and beyond your stereotypical cinematography & complexity! Thus is why many of ""user critics"" are writing low-balling reviews, simply because one does not understand the film nor has the intellect to properly dissect the small-to-grand idiosyncrasies composed from beginning-to-end.If one simply doesn't understand the multi-dimensions of Tenet, don't dismantle a masterpiece just cause it's over-your-head! Embrace the unknown. If you think ""Avengers Endgame"" explains physics better than Tenet, you are confusing sci-fi with actual physics' practices. (Don't get me wrong I love ALL Avengers films). It seems as if any film Watchers & enthusiasts don't have the plot laid out in a rudimentary fashion then it's an automatic negative review. Use your imagination and submerge yourself into the merry-go-round film Tenet, Christopher Nolan is a cinematic marvel guru not for your average viewer with low IQ's."
" A masterpiece
",ignition1377,10,7 September 2022,"Sublime acting, music , screenplay and photography on point.After watching first time I was not so convinced but the film was so good it made me think and wanting to fully understand so dived in for another 3 times. Director , crew and production geniouses.A timeless theme about the dimension of time , played to twist your wit in the most exquisite way, putting aside the usual cliche ( or not !!) of geolopolitical issues .If you want to know a bit more about these concepts, read about philadelphia experiment , remote vision ( started by the soviets) and other de-classified documentations on the experimentation of men vs time and everything will fall into place. Sort of an irony or comical that the artefact capable of destroying our timeline was an algorithm built in a lego like object ."
" The rating of this movie shows you the current state of art
",mohammad-z,10,5 September 2022,"People confuse intelligence with intellect.If you don't understand this movie you might very well have a high level of intelligence, but you surely lack intellect. Especially if you don't want to understand this movie.You have to watch it twice, at least, because the second time you know the for your time linear ending and can view the movie simultaneously forwards and backwards.Many reviewers think the movie is bad because ""they"" didn't grasp the concept of it, they are stuck in linear thinking. Not challenging themselves. Fun fact: Same reviewers complaining about Tenet having ""unreal"" or ""false physics"" concepts, love every Sci-Fi movie packed with impossible nonsense (according to their wording) or Spiderman movie."
" Just not very good. Actually terrible!
",jbla-75984,1,3 September 2022,"It really is terrible acting. That applies all around but who decided that JD Washington should be the lead in any movie. Let alone an actor. His father, Denzel Washington, is amazing but nepotism doesn't make his son a better actor than a pro football player. Also, can't believe the Oscar for special effects honestly. It was sooo obvious that the reverse effects were just rolling film backwards. Seriously, did anyone listen to the soundtrack before they released the movie? A sci-fi movie is supposed to reflect the possibilities the future could bring but the writers had no scientific concept of time travel and resulting paradoxes (let alone good dialog). Even opening your mind to fantastic possibilities in order to enjoy the fun of what could be makes you realize that what the movie presents is just not possible. It's just dumb."
" Either love it or hate it
",sunilpsagar,9,2 September 2022,"I have to confess, i am no Nolan fan and I hated his last three movies. Saw this one on Amazon prime and man this is the best from Nolan for me in over a decade. The take of time travel is great. Just like any dimension, you can go move forward or backward on an axis which I loved. The movie makes more and more sense every time you watch. There is no mindless action or generic men who shoot like they are blind. The plots challenge your thought process and takes multiple viewing to comprehend for a normal human being.It avoids or mocks most of the cliche in secret agent movies. The acting was a bit of a let down and Nolan's casting is just different*
The music is just amazing."
" Disappointingly above average from a writer and director I expect more from
",nscoby93,7,1 September 2022,"This is going to be the hardest review for me to write but I have to be honest and I have to stop reviewing Nolan's films with the fanboy goggles I always have on, that was the point of this marathon.I've seen Tenet now multiple times since it's home release and everytime I get ready to watch it I always think I'll like it more than last time. Unfortunately this just isn't the case. I'll get all the positives done first. This film is absolutely gorgeous, Nolan is in top fashion here from a film making standpoint. Amazing cinematography, fantastic acting, and a great score. But while I thought the score was great personally I felt Hans Zimmer's absence and really wish he was around.John David Washington gave a great performance as the protagonist, though he maybe the protagonist the star of the film in this criticics opinion is Robert Pattinson. He just owned the screen in every scene he was in and his character was the better written character in the film. But both Washington and Pattinson had great chemistry, they played off each other very well. The supporting cast isn't asleep here either. Kenneth Branagh played the role of Sator very well, he was truly menacing. Michael Caine in his small role was great but why is in this film? He's just wasted talent here. Aaron Taylor-Johnson gave a great performance as well in his role as Ives, I've really come to like him as an actor and hope to see him in more serious roles.Yet with all these positives this is unfortunately the weakest thing Nolan I think has written. While the story is intriguing and makes for some great action sequences on film. Nolan's explanation of the key plot element in the entire film is extremely weak. The man who explained things fantastically in Inception can't take the time to explain the complexities of inversion. Granted inversion maybe more complex than anything in Inception but Nolan is a better writer than this. It seems to me Nolan was so focused on making this film the beautiful spectacle it was he forgot the key thing of and I know everyone hates it ""exposition"" it's not a bad word and sometimes it's important.It gives me no pleasure to say all these things, as a huge fan of Nolan's who has pretty much loved every one of his films this is just rather disappointing. At the end of it all this film is just Christopher Nolan running wild all over the screen with the huge budget of $200 million dollars. Also I know for a fact Nolan has done better on way less. But one thing that cannot be denied is the man sure does know how to put on a spectacle.Nonetheless Christopher Nolan is still one of the best directors out there. This film is just not the best he's done. All the same I look forward to Nolan's next film Oppenheimer.This wraps up my Nolan marathon -IMDb: 7/10
Letterboxd: 3/5Watched in IMAX Theater."
" Demands multiple viewings
",anselmdaniel,7,29 August 2022,"This review contains spoilers.Tenet is a science fiction action thriller movie that premiered in 2020. The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan and stars John David Washington as the Protagonist. An attack from the future occurs where objects from the future have reverse entropy and travel into the past.Tenet is an impressive action movie. This is a movie that screams classic Christopher Nolan with impressionable action scenes that are creative in concept and execution. The movie executes these action scenes with simple concepts but it merges them into a complex package. For example, a plane heist occurs where the agents investigate a vault location. They discover someone else is already in the vault and have a reverse fight scene. There are many small touches that the movie does that make each of the scenes have a more complex quality to it. Almost all of the action scenes have this quality to it and the scenes have added depth because of this. Tenet's action scenes are almost perfectly made for a cult following.The fault with Tenet would be its lackluster characters. I feel that this is a problem with Christopher Nolan's writing as many of his characters do not resonate emotionally with the audience. This occurred in other Christopher Nolan written movies where the protagonists do not have much depth. Tenet is no different with how the movie employs its characters. There are basic motivations with the characters driving the events. This is not to say that the acting is poor. John David Washington does a phenomenal job as the protagonist. There was a lack of drama that could have elevated the movie to a classic.The time travel and reversal is one of the best and worst aspects of the movie. The movie utilizes the reversal incredibly with all of the action scenes involving it in some way. The plot is also rife with lots of reversals that impact the way the story plays out. The reversal is impressive but it requires multiple viewings to understand. Good movies with replayability have the audience learning something new about a character or scene. In this movie, a repeated viewing is required to understand character intentions. The characters reverse time and change motivations. This is clear with the villain changing motivations when he was first a bystander. Multiple watches to understand the plot are an annoyance as the story does not gain more depth.I would recommend ""Tenet"" directed by Christopher Nolan.Grade: B."
" Pretty Pretty Pretty Good
",edhutchinson-08617,7,24 August 2022,It's a really good movie but it's at least 30 minutes too long. If it was shorter I'd give it a higher rating. Like many other movies that I fond are way too long. The concepts are very interesting.
" Mindfully Blowing! Run It Back.
",hugo_hilux,7,23 August 2022,"Tenet is a concept movie, both in terms of the concepts it develops and in terms of how those ideas deftly influence the narrative's structure. Time is the key to understanding that idea since it flows and may be altered in accordance with the laws of this planet. Tenet's entire design is closely related to the inverted passage of time, much like how Inception bases its heist format on the idea of dream levels rather than vault intrusion. The more you comprehend the inner workings of Tenet, the more obvious it will become where the world is going, which makes for an enjoyable voyage for the viewer.A calm and assured CIA agent (John David Washington) solely known as the Protagonist receives this unfavorable information. Then it is revealed to him that some items that are dispersed over the globe are traveling backwards in time; they were created in the future and are now travelling into the past. ClÃ©mence PoÃ©sy, an exposition-spouting physicist, has figured out that these ""inverted"" artifacts are the remains of a war that will be waged centuries from now but that would nonetheless wipe out all of history in some way that I didn't comprehend. You get it? No, so did I, but the point is that it resembles a game of dominoes more than a nuclear catastrophe.It is yet another amazing addition to Nolan's body of work. It serves as a successful illustration of the appeal of standalone, non-serialized original storytelling in a world when franchises and sequels rule blockbuster movies. Tenet, however, is Christopher Nolan's ""safest"" film in some time, despite the fact that it breaks new ground. Tenet, the director's third ambitious feature, feels a little staid, as if Nolan's aesthetic were a franchise rather than a framework. Despite this, it nevertheless manages to be more engaging than the majority of tentpole films and serves as a showcase for the director's talents. Tenet serves as an excellent reminder of the potential of blockbuster filmmaking at a time when cinema is perhaps going through its most challenging period in its history. Tenet serves as a great reminder of the potential of blockbuster cinema and the benefits of watching it in a big, dark space."
" Great movie if your intelligent enough to follow along
",rignahhh,10,22 August 2022,"Anyone who rates this movie below a 7 is seriously lacking intelligence. Most people leaving negative reviews admit to either not watching the entire movie or simply not understanding the movie. Is the movie difficult to follow along? Yes... but that's the point of the movie... ""ignorance is our ammunition"" isn't just a phrase for the protagonist, but it's the state we're supposed to be in during a large majority of the movie.We're given pieces to the puzzle during the film that don't quite match up, but by the end everything falls into place perfectly... and that... is a satisfying feeling. That's the genius of the movie. I will admit this movie isn't for everyone, if you're someone who doesn't like to think too hard you'll hate it, but otherwise it's a must watch."

Great for movie fans and those who like complex story lines, not great for anyone who wants a casual experience."
" Don't expect too much
",Zhi-ling,7,17 August 2022,"The movie is hard to understand, but that's okay. You can watch it twice. But I have no interest in seeing it again. It's not like Inception. There are a lot of exciting scenes in the movie, but I don't even feel the tension. The characters are boring."
" Hard to understand
",wkvmjzzpd,8,16 August 2022,Hard to understand but if you watch ten3t 2 times you can understand the film. I like this film. Story is intresting. The performances of the actors are good. But I cant understand the end of the film.
" unsatisfactory
",Shzh-demaoong,7,15 August 2022,"Nolan is telling us what Inception would be like if it didn't work out.The visuals are great, but I still get distracted sometimes, and the characters are boring. Although you can see a lot of effort put into the film, the overall effect is not satisfactory."
" Time travel like no other
",ddouglas793,10,15 August 2022,This movie was da bomb...no pun intended. Nolan outdid himself here...Master piece! Unbelievable writing and so was the casting and the acting! Way more than what I expected. Now I'm gonna have watch Inception...Just like to know if it is even comparable to Tenet since I read recently that Inception was a perfect movie with a twist and I love movies that can keep you on the edge of your seat which is literally where Tenet had me.
" Pseudoscientific mumbojumbo
",gthyni,1,14 August 2022,"Lots of action but I lost interest in the plot b/c the insistence of ""scientific"" explanations that was just word salad. Films do not have to be realistic but this one took pretentiousness way too far."
" Concept
",greatsr,9,14 August 2022,"Perhaps Tenet is the weakest film in Nolan's career. He looks great in the trailer, and is no longer so intricate after 20 minutes of viewing. Yes, the denouement is excellent, the camera work is done at an unrealistic level. But there really is no plot here, the cast is not the strongest, perhaps only Robert Pattinson and Kenneth Branagh stands out. I expected something more, apparently Nolan raised the bar too much. If you compare Tenet with that Inception, then complete degradation in all aspects is on the face."
" P.O.S.
",quarternoteholdings,1,14 August 2022,"Wow. 2.5 hours of my life I'll never get back.I like JD Washington but he needs to pick better scripts. I mean I know it was Covid time but seriously doing nothing would have been better.And Christopher Nolan, you should be ashamed that your name is tied to this. Although most of your stuff is pretty out there anyway. If it wasn't for Batman you'd be looking at a catalog of Too Bad.Do yourself a favour and watch something else. There's many choices and unfortunately mine was a big mistake."
" Nolans weakest film
",travola-35109,7,13 August 2022,"The story pretty much means nothing. You won't care about the characters either. It's like Nolan cranked up the things people complain most about his films. It's loud and you can't hear anyone, the story is weak, weak characters, etc etc.That being said it's obviously a beautiful film. It's a sleek (super sleek) spy thriller. The set pieces are fun and entertaining. If you just watch it as a fun spy thriller with cool things to look at you'll be fine. Don't look for deeper meaning or try and understand the science in this one because none of it makes sense. If it didn't look great and the action scenes weren't fun and I wasn't a big Nolan fan it would probably be a 5.I also really like John David Washington and I want him to be a big star so I gotta give it some love because he's great in the role and I hope he does more action films."
" ð¤ What? Who? ð¤ Intense movie
",znsfh,8,13 August 2022,Likely would have been a 10 if I fully understood it. Loved the idea and the action. Brilliant!Read some reviews and somehow I now know less. Sator Square?Halfway through I just excepted that I don't understand and let myself experience one of the most amazing action scenes to the end. It came together in the last half hour.It's an awesome movie that is very unique and the action scenes will impress you.
" See it for what it is.
",tlght,8,12 August 2022,"First, it's Christopher Nolan. So you know that you will have to watch the movie twice. Second, it's Christopher Nolan, so there's Easter eggs. Third, it's (yeah you know it) Christopher Nolan, so if your looking for the predictable format in entertainment, don't watch Nolan movies...That being said, I enjoyed the architecture of it. Understanding the scenes from both perspectives, The logic of going through the motions, to assure the outcome. Very mathematic in it's form of thinking, once you get it, you see the originality.To respect the format, it couldn't have been done any other way and to enjoy the movie, you have to be in a cerebral, who's done it, kind of mood."
" Watching this feels like working on a test
",daryopeek,7,12 August 2022,"Okay! I get it the director is smart. The movie has interesting concept and several scenes are amazing. However, I think I can't grasp the idea well because the pace and dialogues are too fast. They spoke like in those politics roundtable discussion, thus in the midway I can't follow any of the plot. Maybe I'm too dumb for this movie. I still can enjoy the action though, but not entertained at all. I expect people would love to watch this movie again to make sense the whole story, but I feel like one time is enough. It's like working on a test from a subject I don't understand. I only want to take it once."

" Loved it! Needs rewatching to fully understand
",manonlemieux,9,9 August 2022,"I love when movies are different, even if they fail. For me this was a hit. But like other hard to understand the first time movies, like Mission Impossible, I know I'll watch it again and again and catch more things. I love The Gray Man but it's not super original, this is. Had me right out the gate."
" Definitely worst Nolan film to date
",vdmascarenhas,6,8 August 2022,"The concept is great. It's not time travel, but reversed entropy. But the plot is over complicated, or at least too boring to follow. The acting (apart from the villain) is passable. Soundtrack that usually is superb in Nolans movies is blant. I'm a big fan of Nolan, but he overdone himself in this one."
" Everything but the sound.
",johnorval,8,8 August 2022,"Just watched for the second time, on tv. The balance between the voices and all the other sounds, especially the music, is appalling. This certainly does not help anyone to understand what is going on.It is visually impressive and contains exciting action sequences. The relationshipsbetween the characters could be described as ""British reserved"".It deserves a rewatch or two, helped by a reading of the clues that others have written about.It does not suffer from black screen time as some modern movies do, but, like too many, the sound balance and clarity of vocals is sub par, hence the drop to eight stars."
" Another overblown nolan disaster
",blond1000,1,6 August 2022,"After 10 minutes i was lost, after 60 minutes i was completely lost. After 100 minutes i was in the land of the bewildered, totally! Nolan has a very fertile imaginative mind but he doesnt seem to understand that movies are made for entertainment not for angst and frustration. Like INCEPTION this needs to be watched several times to be understood and even then too many questions remain unanswered. INTERSTELLAR should have/could have been a great movie but like tenet, was totally ruined by incessant loud noise passed off as music score, so bad, loud and annoying that dialogue could not be understood. Such a great pity, visuals were great, but thats all!"
" Hello, I am very suave
",aguinness-48908,4,6 August 2022,"Whitty dialogue that's delivered woodenly quick and complete with multiple smirks - checkCheesey characters pompously swanning around exchanging deep secrets within seconds of meeting to help the storyline - checkWhat? - checkLike mate, I can't make a smooth good video on tiktok but for goodness sake just slow the conversation down and make it seem at least a bit natural, rather than a formality that needs to be rushed to get to the next bravado scene."
" Who knows what the heck is going on?
",pdollak,5,5 August 2022,"The bigger problem is, who cares?Really. It's not clear who anyone is, why they are doing whatever it is they are doing and, as stated at the outset, what the heck is going on."
" Excels in technical filmaking, drags in storyline
",wlee08,6,5 August 2022,"Interesting concept lends itself to a demonstration of technical filmaking, especially in the special effects department, but doesn't lend itseld to a very good story. Some of the scenes crawl to a snails pace while we struggle to connect with any character drama, while the huge scenes, complete with explosions and car chases - scenes we are usually meant to sit back and enjoy - leave us in a state of confusion because of the backwards/forwards thing. Watching it again doesn't seem like it would help either, as its clear the writers felt free to pretty much bend the rules of this game.I have no problem with bending the sci-fi rules, but how do you overlook the obvious stuff - like milllions of dollars (perhaps billions) in gold bullion bars being transported on a regular freight airline without any security, seemingly being pushed around on carts by airport maintenance workers? Even within the first minute something seemed off, as the musicians tuning their instruments at the opera are brought to a sudden hush. If you've heard orchestras tuning up before performance you will know what I mean - theres always one or two instruments that are still tuning for a second or two. They never come to a unanimous quiet on a dime like that. Any musician on set could have pointed this out."
" Passing Thrills
",danielfletcher121,7,4 August 2022,"Nolan has become the Harrods of blockbusters. Delivering a premium range of action movies. As such, with high-end fashion, the raw materials have been taken through a transformative process to produce a high quality item. However, you may say to yourself, I know the quality is there, but it looks a little weird. Can I see myself enjoying it on more than one occassion? You might get the initial thrill and admiration, but it won't replace that slightly cheaper, more enduring item that you will revisit time over.Tenet brings to mind the concept of plural ignorance. Are we saying it's great because we think that we are supposed to, that we just assume that everyone is sycophantic about these overly complex ideas and that we are all afraid to say, 'actually you're talking rubbish there Chris'.The acting is brilliant, the stunts are high octane hypnosis, whilst the last hour feels like watching a school boy return home and tell their parents everything he learnt in physics class that day.Love Chris Nolan. Enjoy his films. But would love to see him just make a really good James Bond or Mission Impossible."
" Artistry
",coilfyzx,9,4 August 2022,"The thing that I love about Nolan, is that he seemingly does his best to totally disregard the QC checklist of a movie. Personally, personally I loved the artistry of the movie. I wish I could go in depth without sounding like I'm whining on his behalf but here we go.I asked myself the questions
1. Does Christopher Nolan know how to ensure that vocals and language are clear in a film? Yes, he's done it before, it's a hallmark of his work.2. Does he know how to develop characters such that the audience knows and relates to the protagonist? Adding; such that we also can predict to varying degrees plot reveals? Yes he can, he's done it countless times.3. Does he know how to prepare the minds of the audience for the plot that is to come? Yes....must I repeat?So if an accomplished Director ""drops the ball"" in any many of these areas, do we call it a bad film, overly clever...or do we not assume intention perhaps?I'll agree Nolan's films aren't for everyone and some people will hate it, they are allowed to. Personally I see his supposed disregard for fundamentals as a fresh approach to story telling. I can always expect a niche experience. All the ""flaws"" of this movie felt very premeditated. I mean this was a movie of two melding time runs. So of course he experimented the HELL out of the pacing, how much we knew and when we knew it. Nolan's movie accomplishes one thing every time, they let you FEEL what it must be like to be in the film. Not knowing and understanding is kinda the point of the film, right? When we finally get told the effect that making that directional switch has, we understand that vision hearing and understanding are blurred. So when WE can't get the details at times doesn't that make you feel like you also made that switch? Should we be surprised that he attempted to give us that experience? In fact weren't we all watching this in reverse? The fact that it all made perfect sense gradually as the movie went on whilst ""missing"" dialogue is proof in my book of his intentions! Controlling the experience like Nolan does is something I'm not sure we're already for.Boiled down therefore, what Christopher Nolan did was read us two bed time stories simultaneously, one in reverse word after word...That is artistry in my books. Writing and Directorial prowess. Captivating! It felt wholly original. Mind you, he is a psychopath for even attempting this, but I love it. More please."
" Had to watch 3 times to understand (a bit)
",apietruchapoczta,6,4 August 2022,"I was mostly confused watching it for the first time, a bit confused watching for the second time and pretty convinced that I understand this plot the third time. I think it's a bit too complicated, it's an action movie in the end. I appreciate the effort though."
" Rate for acting directing music of 10

" Expensive incoherent Waste of money and Time
",ocacia,3,3 August 2022,"A film has a purpose! Like it or love it films have limits. And the gift of any artists is how they are able to communicate through film what they want to communicate. Just because a film bends forward and backwards and ""challenges our mind"" does not make it a masterpiece. It is just a expensive film that bends our mind. Hidden in all of the chaos of this film is poor storytelling. Why does he care so much about that woman and her child? So the motivations are not clear. All respect to Denzel's son but he is very bland and uninteresting. I did Like Kenneth and even Debicki. But within all this mind bending pretentious nonsense there still is no serious story. I did not care as the stakes were not put up high enough to make me care if they won or loss. It is not Dunkirk where you felt they were saving the world. I was not rooting for anyone. Nolan is not pushing boundaries he is just spinning off of Inception. And it is a flop. I cannot remember the music either, only the credits track. There are films you watch and you want to understand the meaning so bad, this is not one of them. Inception worked because within its complexity was a solid story. With solid acting. Please stop giving Nolan blind loyalty so he might rethink his next flick.Technically the dialogue is very hard to hear at times. I had to put up my center channel to 7Db and the volume was all over the place. The fight scenes look so fake, like Matrix 2 and 3."
" Another interesting topic ruined by a loud annoying soundtrack
",boblin2-1,3,2 August 2022,"Per the title of the review, annoying, loud, droning, soundtracks have become a Christopher Nolan trademark. As soon as I see his name on the movie, its off my list of movies to see at the theater. Tenet was one such movie. I watched it this evening on Netflix. I had to turn the volume right down and switch on the subtitles. So, now I've seen it. I will never watch it again, nor will I recommend it, and its all down to the horrible soundtrack.In summary, Christopher Nolan does it again; makes a movie on an interesting topic and then spreads droning, loud, painful, music all over the dialogue, great. Thanks for nothing!"
" Tenet Predicted the Future
",demiller74,10,1 August 2022,"I thought Tenet was a bizarre nonsensical movie, then February 24th 2022 happened. There are so many dang parallels that makes me think Noland distilled Vlad^2 and wrote this movie. Heck he based the Joker on another world leader who robbed banks, killed the help, and didn't care about $ so I shouldn't be surprised, right? Still makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck."
" Could have been good...
",monica-cohn08,4,31 July 2022,"What a mess this movie is. I watched it on demand which meant I could stop and rewind when I was confused, which was often. I enjoyed some of the action sequences and the movie would have been better if it stuck to that without all that ""inversion"" BS. After awhile I stopped paying attention and just wanted it to end because I WAS interested in seeing how things turned out. Film buffs may find the last part interesting with the combination of forward and backward special effects. I must be dim-witted because I still don't understand how the world was saved, (""spoiler"")..."
" Slightly mind bending, lots of fun
",alex-17861,8,30 July 2022,"So having seen a lot of reviews for this film (lots negative), I was a bit worried. Let's be clear, its not one of the great films of cinema or even the best Nolan film. But it's interesting, makes you think a bit, has great action, good cast, and looks lovely. It does benefit from a 2nd viewing mind!"
" Only Nolan can('t) do this
",netmedia-1,10,30 July 2022,"A story which is too much to be told with a movie, or by any means available to humans. This is why it's a messy masterpiece. It deserves a 10/10 for pushing boundaries in a remarkabke way."
" No one talks like this
",pdc15725,4,30 July 2022,"The female characters in the movie seem to speak without inflection, at low volume, and with zero personality. The male characters aren't much better but at least you can hear them. Unfortunately, even if you can get past this, the plot makes little sense."
" A very good movie, a failure for Nolan
",tancrevena,8,30 July 2022,"This movie is a very well built story, however, if we compare it to the other Christopher Nolan's movies, it emerges as one of the worst. Tenet has a different feeling from the others: although the plot seems very intricate and difficult to understand, the real problem lies in the characters: the evolution of some of these is non existing and so they result flat and boring throughout the movie. The only relationship that can be found is the one between Andrei and his wife Kat, however it's not interesting because it wasn't given enough depth. In Interstellar we have the father-daughter realtionship between Cooper and Murph; in Inception we have the husband-wife deal between Cobb and Mal and in The Prestige we have the rivalry between Borden, Angier and the love for their wives. Also the acting was not on a ""Nolan level"" this time: Kenneth Branagh seems unnatural in most of his anger scenes and the actors didn't have to deliver strong performance moments, such as in Interstellar and Inception. Furthermore, in all Nolan's movies there has always been a strong female character, since Memento; but in Tenet Kat's character is rough and not explored in depth. Keeping out the characters, Tenet is a brilliant movie with the incredible idea of time inversion and it's spectacular regarding the special effects on the big screen; GÃ¶ransson's soundtrack is also always on point.In conclusion I feel that this is a really great movie but a failure for Christopher Nolan because it fails in the aspects that made this director strong: the characters, and not only the complicated and impossible to understand plots. Just remember how he could turn a well known character such as Batman in an incredible, never told, story."
" I never really felt connected to this film and I really wanted to like it.
",planktonrules,4,28 July 2022,"""Tenet"" is a Christopher Nolan film that came out in the middle of COVID...so it didn't get the sort of theatrical release you'd expect. In fact, it very quickly came to cable and DVD.The story is a very difficult one to both explain and connect with as you watch. It involves some sort of secret agent and his mission to somehow stop someone from sending items through time. Obviously some evil persons from the future and some from the present are in league together. What is NOT obvious is pretty much everything else about the movie! It is incredibly ambiguous and annoying...much of which is because you really have no idea who the 'Protagonist' (John David Washington) is working for, who he is or, well, pretty much ANYTHING about him. Calling him 'Protagonist' throughout the movie really heightens this problem.In many ways, this is much like the rest of the story...vague and detached. As a result, it was very difficult to connect with anyone nor care about them. All you are left with are some insane stunts and a lot of action...and, oddly, an amazingly boring film. I really wanted to like this one...but it just felt as if the film wasn't meant to be enjoyed by most folks...just the few."
" Back to the Future
",albertval-69560,5,27 July 2022,"I agree with many of the reviews here. The story is over-complicated, chaotic and really confusing what with the moving forward and backward in time.I wasn't inclined to watch it again a second time because it was so frustrating watching it the first time. The ending didn't clearly tell the viewer what happened except for Neil to say that ""what happened happened."" Duh.The sci-fi gobbledygook (entropy of time, temporal pincer movement, turnstiles) was over the top and the viewer needed to be a physicist like Neill to understand the goings-on.I admire the work of Christopher Nolan, particularly, the Batman movies, but this one is inscrutable. And he even wrote the story."
" Bad movie, don't recommend
",buizelxd,3,26 July 2022,"Horrible.I saw lots of movie a lot of them boring, but this movie made me sad and mad, i a way that made me write this review.Ok so everyone is speaking of this movie and recommended me this one.Everyone talked about how masterpiece it is or really
hard to understand is this but the fact is, it isn't.Why?What i have to say is this:
i was really focused to understand this and a lot of things don't come a long. It is not because of the fact that is hard but the fact that you don't get all the information you need for it to understand it.The premise and the main idea is great but they should put a better description on why this is happening and how is happening because that Grandpa paradox was just a tiny bit of the whole process.The characters we're well developed, the choreography behind it was amazing. The plot was 'meh' as i said before. Music was great and the plot twist were least expected
final Rate 3/10
i wouldn't recommend this to any of my friends."
" Confusing
",tiituspoykk,5,18 July 2022,"Hard to follow, didn't know what or why things were happening 70% of the time. This was cool as a concept but the execution could have been more user friendly. Felt like they didn't explain the story enough for me to really get hooked on to it.The score by Travis Scott was good and the ending was also a pleasant but overall, not that particularly great of a movie."
" The Grandfather Paradox
",Mateo-EGC,7,18 July 2022,"A complex feature film, especially for those who are unfamiliar with the topics that the film deals with, such as time travel.Although the first part is weak in certain aspects in which it can get boring, like not understanding anything that happens, in the second half the plot is better understood to reach a great ending. Christopher Nolan is a master with his action scenes, which saves the first half is entertaining, and then demonstrate how great it is to bring to film topics such as time travel.This film is a clear mix of so many genres that Nolan has brought to the movies, although it is understandable that not everyone likes these combinations."
" Nolan's first film that I truly hate.
",TrueCriticism,N/A,18 July 2022,"6.9Tenet is a very well executed film. It has a great concept and it's execution is by no means incredible, squeezing every ounce of juice from said concept to leave a lasting impression on your mind. That being said, it's not good. There are many problems with this film, such as it's runtime and pacing. This movie is a little hard to rate, but it's very clear that this movie is not his greatest.Unlike some of his other movies, Tenet is completely devoid of emotion. The characters are not very interesting to the point where a soap opera would have characters with more depth. This is very, very disappointing if you include the fact that most of Nolan's movies were full to the brim will all kinds of emotions and characters that you can remember.Another problem with this movie is that Nolan may have gotten to carried away with the concept. It's a very interesting one at that, but it's also a bit complicated to the point where multiple videos had to be created for the audience to understand. As I pointed out in my review for Doctor Strange 2, you shouldn't complicate things to the point where the viewer must do their homework to fully enjoy a movie, even though that is what the MCU has become.In conclusion, Tenet is a great film with a great concept, but it seems that it's greatest weakness was the person who created the movie in the first place."
" Poor Sound
",nanobot-90-272383,5,15 July 2022,"Looked interesting the first time, but could not follow dialogue (I read Nolan made it hard to hear for a reason). Between the bad sound and overly complicated reversed time, not worth re-watching."
" Really cool
",jasminn_tan,7,11 July 2022,"Really cool idea but I think I might be too dumb for this movie. I love a good time paradox movie or show and I understood what happened on a surface level but it was still confusing to me. Even so, I had fun watching the action scenes and how the scenes played out in reverse. Truly an interesting experience."
" The sound has been done by an unpaid intern. That's how it feels.
",uvraver,4,10 July 2022,The over dubbing is so poor. No character talks over another so you can tell the actors dubbed alone.This results in a loss of atmosphere and a real amateur feel to the film.The concept is brilliant and I bet there is no logical mistakes. Pre-planning meant there was no budget left for sound.But the concept is played out in a simplistic back story.Shows how hard it is to make a clever and great film I suppose.
" Just Absorb the effects don't overthink it
",lakings97,6,10 July 2022,"Tenet is a Christopher Nolan movie that he wrote, directed and produced. This is the first movie from Chris that I didn't care for much. The script was overly complicated and hard to follow. John David Washington was the actual Protagonist, he acted as the good guy but he was actually a bad guy but you don't know it. Robert Pattinson acts as his British counterpart to help the survival of the world from those who travel back in time to make a change at a certain point to our timeline. Kenneth Branagh played the Russian Oligarch who wants to change the timeline. The cast also included cameos from Michael Caine and Wes Chatham. Overall great concept with great special effects especially we reverse slo mo action sequences, but this isn't a movie I would watch again."
" If I could turn back time
",NPIan,1,9 July 2022,That's two hours and twenty three minutes (one hundred and forty three minutes in total) of my life I won't get back. Or will I?Absolutely complete and utter tosh.
" Incomprehensible tosh
",songtsan,4,8 July 2022,"I love sci Fi and will watch any movie but I think this was "" the emperor has no clothes"" they came up with a single theme and tried to make it into a movie like . Inception it is not however and tries to be way to clever for itself rather than create possibly a way more comprehensible and flowing movie."
" A late review after my second time watching this greatness!
",khalidmoubile,9,7 July 2022,"Tenet.""Christopher Nolan in his lastest movie adopting the time inversion hypothesis, it's about an unnamed protagonist and his journey through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that defines time differently.""This is my second time watching this supernatural masterpiece and I'm as shocked as I was after the first or even more!I remember that people kept saying that Nolan exaggerated in terms of making his film complicated to be fully understood, and all the bad feedbacks about Tenet, but man don't you see how wonderful this project is? How it's perfectly executed?I just realized that this is absolutely the best directing in an action /sci-fi movie I've ever had the pleasure to watch!The action scenes were fantastic for a sci-fi film, but the inverted action scenes were too perfect and too much for a human's brain.Besides the excellence of directing, screenplay isn't a weak part, it might have some problems in terms of explaining more what we saw in this film, but Nolan has trusted us to get every piece of his puzzle, And I'm telling you after watching it two times, a couple of pieces are missing!The storyline was full of twists, Mind-blowing ones, the dialogs weren't the best thing about this movie, a little bit ""over symbolic "".Christopher Nolan isn't the only protagonist of this film, the charismatic John David Washington and the amazing Robert Pattinson are included, their action scenes were perfectly performed as their dialogs, I loved the chemistry and the partnership between the too actors and characters.Elizabeth Debicki did well either , but their was a problem in her relationship with the protagonist, it's maybe the first time I witness a disappointing fail of Nolan to make one of his movies strong dramatically.Finally the question is, Did Christopher Nolan reached his brain's limits after this film or he can go farther. Anyway I'm ready for his futuristic projects, and I can't wait to watch more of this man's work."
" Difficult to understand and follow
",bofid-21027,3,6 July 2022,This movie goes way too fast for the subject matter and tries to explain complex abstract concepts without giving time for the viewer to comprehend and digest what is being portrayed.The opening scene is very confusing and i had no idea what was going on.I gave up 1/4 of the way through.Some good actors though.
" Screen Riot Podcast - Tenet (2020) Review
",ScreenRiotPodcast,7,6 July 2022,"Screen Riot Score - 6.6/10""Don't try to understand it. Feel it"" - Tenet (2020)The movie quote takes the words right out of my mouth. Christopher Nolan's, Tenet is an action-packed, Sci-fi thriller with just enough Nolan nuances to leave audiences wanting just a bit more exposition. Of course, this is just like Nolan to leave viewers knowing they watched a good film but leaving the theater with more questions than answers. This is the magic of his films that keeps us coming back for more.A Hero's AwakeningTenet is the story of a man we know only as The Protagonist (John David Washington). Starting as a CIA agent infiltrating a Russian Opera house siege, the Protagonist is attempting to save a spy carrying radioactive material. While rescuing this individual he encounters a bullet that travels backward out of a bullet hole, past his head, and through the enemy agent behind him. We see that bullet travel into the barrel of a gun. The agent holding the gun turns and runs away and we see a keychain dangling from the backpack he is carrying.Unfortunately, when he arrives at the getaway truck, he's ambushed and knocked unconscious. He wakes up in a train yard being tortured and decides to take the suicide pill his near-dead co-worker offers. Surprisingly, he wakes up in an infirmary being greeted by a man who tells him that the pill was a test of loyalty and offers him a new job. He is only able to arm the Protagonist with a word...""Tenet"" and a sign (crossing the fingers of both hands together in front of your stomach).The Protagonist somehow knows when cars are left specifically for him and what to do even when there seems to be no direction. The audience tends to accept this as the work of a spy. Then, he meets up with a scientist who tells him (and us!) about objects that have been reversed. She is the one who states the opening line of this review so eloquently.Through a series of twists and turns, a bunch of cool spy stuff, a very tall blond, and confusing pseudoscience explanations, we ultimately learn that Sator (Kenneth Branagh), a Russian oligarch, is helping the people of the future as they attempt to send a doomsday device back in time to wipe out all of humanity to change their bleak future.With the help of an agent named Neil (Robert Pattinson), the Protagonist defeats Sator, saves the world, and the tall blond, Kat (Elizabeth Debicki), of course.For what should be obvious reasons, this is a very short synopsis. As stated, there are so many questions with this film that it is impossible to ask and answer all of them here. It's highly recommended you listen to our podcast review to more fully understand what takes place in this highly confusing movie.While Nolan does a great job with his writing and filmmaking, viewers need a bit more explanation for scenes. He tries his best, color coding the different timelines and even inverting air flowing into the lungs, but it's ultimately not enough to quash the confusion.While the movie has many positive aspects, the audio mix for this film is terrible.The dynamic range is set so wide that it's near impossible to hear spoken words. Yet, the explosions are deafening. So be prepared. In a film that needs a great deal of exposition, audio is key and the editors just missed the mark.Washington's acting is reminiscent of classic James Bond with all his swagger and class. An air of sophistication shines through whether he is trading blows with a foe or convincing a hardened criminal to trust him. It is doubtful that another actor would have embraced the character so willingly and thoroughly. If you like him in Ballers, you will love him in Tenet.A pleasant surprise was Robert Pattinson in the role of Neil. He has come a long way from being a shiny vampire in the Twilight saga. Instead of glistening with glitter like mist, he is a pretty good action star glistening with only sweat. In a movie where the acting is just as important as the action, Pattinson does an excellent job.The role of Sator is expertly played by Kenneth Branagh.With each passing scene, Branagh takes Sator deeper and deeper into his troubled psychosis. Sator is determined to not only end the world for his future masters but also torture Kat, his all-but-estranged wife. Kat, determined to take control of her and her son's life, ultimately kills her husband in a very satisfying scene.For those who like to escape into films and not think about them, this may not be your cup of tea. However, if you like to sit back, analyze, and dissect films, hold on to your hats because it's about to get real!Enjoyed this Review? Consider visiting our YouTube Channel by searching Screen Riot!"
" Whoa!
",mark-makin,7,3 July 2022,"I finally got round to watching this, I've had it since Christmas 2021.Great story line. It was fast paced dialogue which I've read people moaning at. You definitely have to concentrate on the film, it's not one to put on and casually watch.Thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.The only part that was sooooo lame (spoilers) was the part where he pressed the brake pedal with his fingers!!! Terrible decision to film it like that. That was the only part that detracted it for me.That's why I only gave it a 7/10."
" Thrilling
",scratcherjoseph,7,2 July 2022,"Really cool concept, some really loud music, can't really hear the conversation. Action scenes are really epic. This is the Nolan type of film that you have to watch at least twice to understand. Really loved it!"
" Very wierd
",amirrvasegh,2,30 June 2022,"It's so confusing. While you are processing a data shown in last scene you will miss the new data of new scene, also the soundtrack in the movie was so loud that made me really hate the movie and I simply couldn't watch it till the end, (idk if it's just me but I got anxious of the music and I wanted to throw up..)
On the other hand the acting was okay I believe."
" Extremely underrated
",bosmfm,9,30 June 2022,"This movie is exceptionally good. It is one of those titles that is just at another level than most movies. It is however, really complicated. Things go fast and there is quite some philosophical thought experiments throughout. I can see how the movie goes straight over the head of most people. I don't say that out of arrogance, because I experienced this myself. The first time I watched this movie I was able to keep up and it was an amazing experience. I decided to watch it again to fully grasp what is going on, and funny enough, the second time around it went too fast for me. I couldn't connect the dots in a way that I truly understood it, and that made the experience a lot less enjoyable. This is also testament to how complicated this movie is: a second viewing still doens't guarantee a solid grasp on the story.I do beleive that when rating a movie here I should focus on what the movie can bring. I would strongly recommend people to watch it again if they didn't like it the first time, and perhaps even a third time. Pretty weird to recommend people to watch a movie they didn't like several times, but its the only way to truly know if you like it or not.Anyway, no spoilers, but this movie is brilliant."
" I'm so confused..
",s_eidem,3,28 June 2022,"This was just exhausting to watch. Halfway through the movie I just wanted it to end. Washington's acting was NOT good, I guess he was confused as well, it sure looks like it... steer clear of this movie."
" Its A Supermodel
",damianphelps,4,28 June 2022,"Plenty to look at but not much else going on I'm afraid.Spends way too much time being impressed with itself.The lead character lacks charm, presence and spark which is not great in a 'hero' role.This is a miss I'm afraid :)"
" If possible, watch this WITH SUBTITLES
",Lee-Schloss,10,28 June 2022,"Subtitles makes a huge difference, otherwise this movie will be very difficult to follow along and enjoy.I must strongly disagree with the negative reviews. Watching this made me feel like Nolan outdid himself. The way it handled time travel was mindboggling, but it did seem to put the pieces together really well.And in an era when other movies are using time-travel as a cop-out to avoid failing to resolve, I didn't sense that here.I would still rank Nolan as among the best directors of all time."

At the beginning , his assignment seems to be to rescue a man, which he does so with the help of a team with whom he blends in with SWAT teams. During the operation, the plutonium is found to be fake. Furthermore, The Protagonist realizes that the opera was being bombed and so he collects the bombs to save the people. The Protagonist is at gunpoint by one SWAT member but is saved by a masked gunman with a red string on his back. The masked man appeared to be using a time-reversed gun. The starring throws the bag of bombs away and attempts to save the dangerous situation . He is then kidnapped and tortured until he bites on an apparent suicide pill before revealing any information. Later on , The Protagonist teams up with his brave new partner , Neil (Robert Pattison) to avoid the Third World War and following a faint trail of tracks that lead to the villainous Russian oligarch, Sator (Kenneth Branagh) married to Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) .

" IMO REVIEW
",ndraprema_,8,22 June 2022,"This film was very interesting for me, in terms of cinematography, sound designing and the other cinematic supporting elements that make me to watch this film to the end."
" Untenable Tenet
",filmpurveyor,2,21 June 2022,"Like others, I believed the media hype and critical praise for this flick, so finally got time to sit down and watch it. I was left frustrated and bored.As usual, Nolan assumes long running times of his films equals gravitus. Nolan seemily wanted to throw everything and the kitchen sink into this one. Espionage, double crosses, time travel, love affairs, boats, gold bars, pillows, planes and trains and automobiles too. But I was already checked out of the film's story when the time travel drivel was introduced, made no sense, and wasn't explained very well either. I think Nolan wanted to keep it vague, and hoped the audience would just run with his flimsy premise. Big mistake. The whole film is predicated on this time travel stuff, and just metastasised into a unintentionally silly affair. Cars driving backwards and then some cars driving forward, at the same time? Characters fighting themselves in the present, from the past? You got me, made no sense to me either. I'm sure this all makes sense in the internal logic of the film's plot, but unfortunately just left me bewidered and aghast that Nolan is trying to sell us this stuff. At least Robert Pattisnon's golden locks looked good, and was a visual saving grace from this miss."
" Nolan should stick to character studies, lay off the ""science""
",andrewwhopkinson,2,18 June 2022,"This movie continues along the same vein as Interstellar, trying to be some deep, complex sci-fi type of story with a lot of ""scientific"" garbledeegook that Nolan probably got from watching a few youtube videos. Now I know this because I too browse around youtube watching interesting science documentaries or science based channels, however I don't go around making movies pretending like I understand them enough to try and weave it into a plot and have it make sense. And that is the biggest problem of this movie and Intersteller, the incredible pretense. The pretentiousness just oozes from every over acted, mumbled scene and it is infuriating. Francis Ford Coppolla said that making a pretentious film is the worst sin a film maker can make. Just because Nolan has scientific advisors does NOT mean any of the story makes sense or is scientifically plausible. Basically it just means Nolan asked them ""is entropy a thing?"" ""I saw on a youtube video that electrons move backwards in time, is that true?"" (which btw, after doing some quick googling, that is a positron, not an electron).I won't try and explain the plot, because honestly I didn't really understand it, nor do I think did Nolan. Something to do with time travel, World War III, an ""algorithm"", things and people being ""inverted"" or some such nonsense. (And btw, an algorithm is a mathematical formula or set of functions not a 4 foot long piece of metal!). You know a movie is bad when there is constant exposition and dialogue where people just explain the plot. Somebody once said that movies should show and not tell, after all they are primarily a visual medium. 2001 A Space Odyssey is a perfect example of this, there is very little dialogue in the movie, almost none in the third act. It lets the viewer try and figure things out, but does not have everything at a rediculous kinetic energy like Tenet does so you don't even have time for your brain to process. I think that is done by design. If some part of the movie doesn't work, instead of fixing it, Nolan just does some quick edits, and then throws in some pseudo scientific mumbo jumbo and then moves on. A good movie is more than just impressive visuals and actors ""emoting"" in a very serious way, on the surface it makes you feel like you are watching a great movie, until you realize that the plot makes no sense and that there is no connecting between the characters, or as a viewer, for the characters.A lot of this movie almost seems like a parody of Nolan, people speaking quickly and almost inaudibly, sometimes with food in their mouths, sometimes while sailing in loud winds with headsets on etc. Does Nolan do this intentially to hide problems or to make you watch the movie multiple times? I'm not sure, either way it is very annoying.After watching Tenet, I went back and watched some earlier Nolan movies like Memento, which is actually a great movie. Sometimes less is more, and Nolan did a lot with a limited budget, and used the reversing shooting effect ONCE for maybe 30 seconds, as opposed to every 10 minutes over and over to dazzle the eye and numb the brain. Nolan should go back to these character studies and leave the sci-fi movies alone."
" Didn't happen
",muratdolan,1,18 June 2022,"A soup in which every ingredient is thrown into the script. No taste, no salt. I respect your career, but this time it didn't happen. If you need to sleep, try watching a little at night and get a good night's sleep."
" Bye Saab, baas eyB
",ronsonx,7,18 June 2022,"They wrecked a late Saab 9-5, that should set the violence/gore at severe.I am shocked over this simple fact.In fact, it made me write this, which is my first review."
" Back in time
",rbnlrk,10,18 June 2022,"I canÂ´t describe this movie but this is a movie at times played backwards starting in an heist during an opera. From that there is fanstatic chases and it ends in an war zone. If you love art and indie movies go stream this if you have 3 hours. Such a shame the movie was out during the worst part of the corona, so this did not get as much love as Inception did but at least there was some Oscars and Golden Globes for Tenet."
" At first glance may seem overcomplicated and lacking but upon closer inspection is an extraordinarily well done film
",samzins,9,16 June 2022,"Tenet is an interesting one... it attempts to pull off an extremely ambitious concept that many think is overcomplicated. I originally thought similarly, but if you read into it, the plot is brilliant. It's one of the smartest movies I've ever watched. It isn't perfect (there was one physic that was flat out wrong) but it sure is close. The characters may seem shallow at first but after a rewatch, you'll see they actually have a decent bit of depth. The acting is really well done, something that isn't as apparent on first viewing but really stood out on the second one for me."
" Ah yes.
",eclee-59960,7,15 June 2022,"This is probably one of the most confusing films I've ever seen. Admittedly, I thought it was bad on first watch. But after thinking about how well made it truly is Tenet grew on me. The problem with this movie is it's better on rewatch, since your first viewing may not be as enjoyable."
" Tenement
",cwuk-35826,1,14 June 2022,"What's so bad about this, apart from the fact it's a nonsensically piece of garbage is the fact kb is so self entitled he doesn't get the title just says Soweto. Bad enough he thought prancing around with a stupid moustache, but this is just stupid utter tripe."
" This isn't one of Nolan's most satisfying films
",tim-stjames,9,13 June 2022,"By the time it's done, you might not know what the hell's gone on, but it is exciting nevertheless. If it had paid as much attention to its writing and character work as it did to its visual and conceptual ambitions, it could have been a masterpiece instead of merely great. But it's still great. In the end, this isn't one of Nolan's most satisfying films. But after I've seen it four or five more times, maybe I'll change my mind."
" Movie is all concepts, no soul.
",EnenArus,5,13 June 2022,"This movie is interesting, and focuses exclusively on events in a unique way. Most movies care about their characters, and at least partially use them as ways for the audience to enjoy the movie. Tenet doesn't care about the characters at all, and it makes the film weird.Most of the film is dialogue, but none of the dialogue is for developing the characters, all of it is for context. There are some ideas that Tenet really wanted to work, and some of them are cool to think about, but none of them are solid enough to completely hold up the movie in my opinion, and not creatively or excitingly presented enough to be justified.In its current state, Tenet would actually have been better as a book that you read, or even a conversation of someone explaining the concept of the movie to you. That's how little soul the movie has."
" Great and typical Nolan kinda movie!
",kfdiest,9,13 June 2022,"Please make more of these unique kind of movies! Nolan is again delivering a master piece. I would have rate it with a 10 if the main character wasn't Washington, because for me he doesn't add any real value to this movie ..by this I mean it could have been any male character. Pattinson, with his great performance, seems like the main character even though he's not ...that's says enough.Nevertheless, movie wise this is a masterpiece and I've seen it several times now. Great story, concept and awesome score (not zimmer, but I'm really satisfied)."
" Stupid movie
",shashweta,1,6 June 2022,Simping behind a giraffe when the world is at stake really? It was made to look like it is a masterpiece but so many loose end. What's the significance of a stupid woman who has only revenge and her own son on her mind? Why those two idiots focused on saving that woman? Didn't like it at all. I have started to think Nolan is overrated.
" Nonsense
",larssonabout,4,5 June 2022,"What awful nonsense. Nolan has been known to sail close to the wind at times with silly sci-fi premises underpinning his plots e.g. Inception and Interstellar, but up to now these excesses are largely forgiven such is the quality of his direction. However, his propensity for such silliness reaches its nadir here (using time travel to avert WWIII: huge yawn) and swamps any potentially redeeming features of the film."
" For a minute I just listened
",randishme,N/A,4 June 2022,This isn't a movie review. Rather it's a revelation about the moment I wasn't watching and just listened to the dialogue. I could've sworn that I heard Denzel Washington's voice and so I looked at who was playing the principal role and realized it was Denzel's son. I didn't know he had a son who was an actor. I'm impressed by his acting skills and was heartened by how identical his voice is to his his father. A new Hollywood dynasty.
" I am a fan of many Christopher Nolan films but, here, he really lost the plot
",damodara_and_radha,1,3 June 2022,The plot is way too dense to be engaging - too many twists. He got it right with Inception and the Prestige - two of my favourite films. Just the right amount of confusion and integration. This one doesn't pull it off. Too disintegrated. By the end one no longer cares and is merely happy it's over. Very disappointing.
" Masterpiece
",winkyinky,10,2 June 2022,"Absolutely, absolutely amazing.The attention to detail and the otherworldly plot. I loved it.A unique idea is one thing, but a unique idea done well is another and rare."
" Soulless.
",inacan-90-894261,3,29 May 2022,"Nolan is a skilled director but why do I consistently feel his movies lack soul? 2.5 hours that feels like 6, a muted and cold film that has potential to be so much more...but isn't. It's frustrating to see all the pieces laid out but assembled in such a odd way. If you are a visual person you'll like it but if you like a film that surrounds you and takes you in. This isn't one.Long, needlessly complex, bereft of soul and bland. The actors look bored and the film has less charisma than a IBS commercial."
" One of Nolans Overambitious Films.
",joe_jr,8,27 May 2022,"When it comes to Christopher Nolan, I am without a doubt someone who admires pretty much everything about him and his work, however, sometimes it is important to step back and realize what things are and where they are going.In this film, Nolan reaches a new level of ambition. I would not call it ""pretentious"" as it accomplishes its mission and in an almost flawless way, however general audiences might not appreciate the cinematic and artistic aspects of the film as Nolan might have hoped. If he continues on this track, really only other filmmakers and some extreme film/Nolan enthusiasts will understand and appreciate the films he makes. While Nolan films have always had underlying meaning, the underlying meaning is beginning to surface and confuse the audience.The film attempts to explain the necessity of the things unseen (editorial in film, special ops teams in the film) to stop unseen threats, but hits too much at the intertwining plot points and adventurous film elements (use of non-linear editing and messing with the spacial and temporal dimensions, as well as the sound design, intentionally making it sound like you're with them, causing dialogue to be difficult to hear in loud scenes). While all these elements make the film rewatchable for some, others will inevitably find it repulsive.Overall, if you're a Nolan or hardcore film theory fan, you'll love this film and find yourself watching it over and over. If not, it might be a one time watch. However, from a filmmaker's perspective, this is a beautiful and creative adventure that only Nolan could pull off. While confusing, very well thought through (as all Nolan films are)."
" It's an art, not a commercial movie
",sabinrusuionut,10,25 May 2022,"Guys, this movie is NOT made for people who like Avangers. This movie is made for people who like art... real art. If you watch any movie that became one of the greatest in history, you will not understand it because the paychogy behind it and the subtext of the dialogue and the fine theme... everything is hard in an artistic movie.Yes, he is a genius. Yes, the movie is very very hard. But every psychological movie ia hard. Why painters still paint abstract art? Because it is one of the greatest arts on the planet, even tough I don't like it at all. But I don't matter in this equation. People who understand it matter.The same with this movie. Is NOT for everyone. Is like abstract art. And it's one of the finest arts in the world.Please don't judge him and don't criticize him if you did not understand the movie. Maybe we cannot understand his inner genius."
" Confusing but fun to watch
",st_hei,7,20 May 2022,"It's a lot of back and forth in the timeline of the story, but the director has such a control over the story and movie that it doesn't get frustrating. Not for me at least. There's a lot of things happening, but it's a movie where everything makes sense a long the story, or at least in the end (if you're not smart and get what's happening from the start)"
" It's not complicated - it's just ridiculous.
",film-watcher,2,19 May 2022,"People say this movie is too complicated. It's not complicated - it's just ridiculous.The time inversion thing doesn't make sense because which ever way you claim to understand it, there are plot holes after plot holes. It's just a gimmick to bewilder people, whilst showing reverse video clips edited with forward video clips, that are supposed to be entertaining. It wasn't entertaining.Poor casting for lead actor - he looks stoned and withdrawn in too many scenes - no way convincing as the supposed role of 'protagonist'.Pretentious and bombastic script writing.Audio mix is terrible. Can't even understand what actors are saying often.Score is atrocious.Overall a waste of time."
" Rewatch it!
",niels-janssen-83927,8,16 May 2022,I watched it 2 years ago when the movie released and liked it but on the 2nd time you just get it so much better. Robert Pattinson does a great job as Neil and the Ending of the movie is just a bitter-sweet conclusion to a story that already has happened.
" Under achievement
",hummerkin,3,15 May 2022,"Story is good....... Casting was the hindrance.......
Supporting cast was un relatable
Lead cast was monochromatic. Virtually the worst character audience relationships ever.Casting director definitely is to blame as well as the director for allowing this dribble to be made in this way...."
" What?
",sigpret,5,12 May 2022,"Why do you make a story about to opposing time lines even more confusing then necessary? Even before the time traveling begins the whole story is told in an absolutely ununderstandable way. Too bad, I really was looking forward to this movie."
" No Nolan. That's not how time and physics work
",naroiden,1,12 May 2022,"I never heard this movie until I found ""We Remade Tenet For $20"" on Youtube. The movie seemed so BS about time so as a person who is sucker for anything related to time I had to watch it and damn it's indeed BS.Nolan clearly didn't have primary school education nor he really don't have the brain to understand simple physics because everything about physics in the movie is so wrong.First of all Nolan has no idea what entropy is. It simply means a law of universe about how everything has to change. As anything change they become less of their original form so the difference between change is measured and called entropy. For example an iron gets rusty which rusted iron - iron = entropy. For example 20 years old you - 10 years old you = entropy. So entropy is a measure of the change. In physics and chemistry entropy is calculated by the change of energies. In social sciences entropy is calculated by the change of society like population, the ratio of poor comparing to rich, et cetera.So in universe you can't reverse anything because entropy exist. That's why you can't reverse entropy. To reverse entropy you had to somehow remove entropy effect from an object in which it would just stop doing anything and it wouldn't be affected by anything. So for example imagine somehow you made a ball not affected by entropy, the ball would be frozen in time in a way it couldn't be affected by the gravity so it would just stay in the point of the universe when it losed the affect of the entropy. The world would move away from the ball while ball just stay where it was before. So reversing entropy is against the law of the universe bruh. Can you froze time by change? No. That's why you can't reverse time because time doesn't exist but entropy exist but the existence of entropy itself make it impossible to reverse entropy. Even if time had existed entropy itself couldn't let us reverse anything because what happened happens because of what caused the entropy in the first place. For something to change first you need to trigger it. That's how what we call time works. It's cause and affect. Without cause there cannot be an affect and affect cannot cause a cause that made affect happen in the first place. You can't produce egg from cake because the energy is different. Energy as form can transform in one way which it cannot be reversed. So that's why you can't undo a burned book. Burned book is burned. A book ain't a book because of the form of energy it currently has, it's a book because of what kind of energy transformed into a book. So trying to undo a burned book to a book would be like trying to produce egg from a cake. To make understand entropy better and why Tenet is idiotic you can think of this: You could born because of your mother and father and you can't make yourself born by having sex with your mother. But in Tenet child makes their mother born from themselves so that's why it's impossible. But Nolan says a child borns because when you reverse the video of child make their mother born it looks like mother make the child born by reversing the definition by defining it as ""born is when mother comes out of their child"" but logic-wise what you see doesn't matter because it's not what we call ""born"". So in the movie they fire a gun and bullets unshoots itself and they enter into the magazine. But dear Nolan have you actually thought even though the bullet has the effect of reverse entropy how can stuff that has no effect of reverse entropy still can make reverse entropy works LOL.Also let's say somehow you made an object have reverse entropy. But in the world of entropy that has no reverse entropy an object couldn't have reverse entropy because time flows forward. That's why what would happen is object being frozen in time because it would be like swimming against a current therefore your speed of swim would cancel out the speed of the current. Since entrophy has the equal force, reverse entropy and entropy cannot have more power over other since to make it reverse it has to be equal in force otherwise it would be some another kind of entropy so that's why the object would be frozen in time.Also by logic wise, 2 objects having 2 opposite direction in time is against logic because try to make a movie have 2 different timeline by reversing the orders of some scenes, you'll fail to make an event order that ensured the cause and affect order because of entropy. Time doesn't process in forward but what happens happens in domino effect in which a piece falls because other piece falls so how can you make a piece fall without making the previous piece fall bruh. That's why you cannot reverse time. Universe is not VHS tape LOL. In VHS tape you can rewind just because there is order in the frames but universe has no such order on what event happens. In universe energies transform to something else which is why what we call time can happen. So what's possible instead is freezing time by making energies stop doing anything and speeding the time flow because entropy can either have the value of zero or entropy affect can speed up. Also in universe what we call time happens in the way X make the Y event happen because Y existed because of X event happened so the existence have duality in it so the whole big bang may actually happened as a paradox in which end of universe may have started the beginning of the universe.Which is the understanding Nolan sucked at Tenet so the whole movie is about some people trying to prevent some bad guys from producing egg from a cake LOL."

",stephenhensley,6,12 May 2022,"The concept behind Tenet is fascinating, and the movie sports truly remarkable sequences at the beginning, middle, and end of the movie.With all its potential and with those great action shots, it's even more intriguing why everything else in-between those scenes is so bad. Right from the outset of the movie, we are teleported from scene to scene, from character to character, every step force-feeding the viewer with unintelligible exposition and cookie-cutter dialogue.However, weathering the script is worth it for the movie's wonderful, mind-bending sequences... at least for one viewing."
" Complexity killed the movie
",guenterfmang,5,11 May 2022,"The concept is interesting, but the execution is too complex and confusing. At some point I stopped trying to follow the story and just watched the pictures. Defintitely not an easy movie."
" Great story, action and characters but lacks in editing and pacing
",jcsallows,8,8 May 2022,"This is a spy thriller caught up with a criminal Russian oligarch (Kenneth Branagh) who uses time travel as a weapon to thwart his enemies. The protagonists (John Washington and Robert Pattinson) are secret agents attempting to catch this oligarch and apprehend the dangerous time travel tools he's using.If you enjoyed the trailers, you're probably getting as much as you'd expect. It's a movie with great action, acting, special effects, story, and characters. And that story may not be for everyone, but it's pretty clever if you can wrap your head around it. I would argue the story is a little more compelling in ""Inception"" versus this movie, but Christopher Nolan fans (I think) will be happy with this one. This is worth watching at least once, and the complexity of the plot (and camera framing) will allow you to enjoy repeat viewings. The story itself is like watching a puzzle unfold in that several scenes move forward and backward simultaneously.Now, for my personal opinion. I know Nolan is ambitious, but this is a little much for me. This feels like a 1,000-page novel (which would have been better paced and explained) crammed into a mainstream, 2-hour Hollywood movie. The editing is so fast paced that everything feels like it's fast-forwarding to get to the next plot point. This would have been better as a limited series or multi-part movie franchise. There are so many jump-cuts and setting changes that I can barely tell what's happening half the time.The dialogue also doesn't help. Everyone speaks quickly, in a monotone voice, and sometimes with so much shorthand that they don't even sound human. I believe that secret agents might talk to each other this way, but it sounds ridiculous when ""regular civilians"" get involved in the story. It's forced exposition at twice the speed.If you're a superfan of Nolan movies, spy thrillers, or even enjoy an action movie now and again, this is already your genre anyway. Because it's Nolan, this is better than your generic genre movie to begin with. But I think many audiences will be left confused both because of the complexity of the plot alongside all the rushed exposition. It's a good movie in its own right, but I can't help but feel that Nolan could do better."
" I wish TENET was real because then i could unsee this
",trollcollect,3,7 May 2022,"I have never seen a more confusing, random and incoherent movie, and at the same time it is obvious how this is a high end production. Did noone tell them they cant release it like that? The moment you try to actually understand whats going on is the moment you regret turning it on. THere are so many other and better options to invest more than two hours."
" Has problems
",brendan-wag,4,7 May 2022,"I think the core of the issue here is that people think the story is another game changer, but if you take away the theatrics, it's actually a basic, and very predictable. Why does any of it matter?"
" 2nd time's the charm
",sleemice,9,3 May 2022,"I watched it on an 8 hour flight and this movie helped some of the hours disappear. It's an amazing movie. I love it. I actually wish it could have continued for another hour so I could see more of the relationship between Pattinson and washington. I wish hollywood made more movies like this. Hoewever, I admit I only understood this movie the 2nd time I watched it. It's not like mrvel movies where you can go to the kitchen and bathroom and things will still make sense when you come back...... In Tenet, every second and blink counts."
" I saw this movie for the 2nd time today... will see it for the 1st time tomorrow
",dopefishie,8,2 May 2022,"Nolan's films keep getting brainier and brainier. Wow this one was hard to follow and will probably benefit from repeat viewing. The action is incredible! I loved the reverse/forward motion sequences.I will note that this one is not as emotionally powerful as most of his other films. I think Nolan went a little too cerebral on this one. The character/acting highlight is Elizabeth Debicki who has the best character arc and brings the strongest performance.Overall, it's wonderfully complicated stuff that you'll spend days scratching your head over."
" Did you watch Inception?! ð
",csseifmostafa,8,28 April 2022,"Nolan keeps on directing entropy's stuff perfectly.I can relate and notice how far Nolan is developed in 10 years difference since Inception release.I like it so much except the soundtracks.I saved it to my birthday to go in journey bounded with time. It was hard & nice.Merci, Nolan and the entire crew."
" Definitely a cool concept
",amkn75,7,26 April 2022,"I wasn't sure if I'd give this movie a 7 or 8 (out of 10), but decided on a 7.The reason for this is that although the concept of the movie is ingenious, it falls in the traps of many Hollywood clichÃ©s.Tenet is a long movie, but I think that was kind of okay, and it was constantly entertaining. When I watch it again, I will for certain, I will most likely bump it up to an 8/10."
" It's about damn time
",hydrofilic,9,26 April 2022,"Below I'll tell you what's good, but to begin I must warn all readers this movie is very long. And not just the slowly-developing kind some people might enjoy -- it is packed full of action, exposition, and new ideas to contemplate. Many have complained about the length, and I can't blame them. So if you are impatient, skip this movie, and save yourself the time.I love the fantastic cinematography; the locations, characters, costumes, lighting, and FX are all a beauty to see. It has a nice mix of action sequences and personal conversations.It is a science-fiction counter-terrorism adventure. Although fiction, the producers put a lot of effort into putting real science into the premise. It involves reversing the entropy of objects (bullets, people, vehicles, etc.) which has the effect of said objects moving 'backwards' in time from a normal perspective. Although other affects like heat-exchange (temperature/entropy) get reversed.Anyway, we the story revolves around an un-named character only referenced as ""a/the protagonist"", who is/was a CIA operative until ""killed"" but then recruited into a secret organisation designed stop World War III; but it is not a nuclear war fought to avoid, but a temporal one!The film has a very brisk pace, with seemingly not enough time to explain the science or the characters. But as said at the beginning, it is already a long film, so it would be UNBEARABLE (my opinion) if more time were spent on those aspects (maybe a clever editor could find things to cut to make room, but that would be a challenge).Anyway, I enjoyed the many a-chronic sequences in the film. By which I mean scenes which make sense when viewed forward in time or if reversed in time. Some of the a-chronic sequences follow almost back-to-back, while others play out over an extended period of time.Overall I enjoyed the thought-provoking causality-deifying action sequences. I've read many complaints that it didn't make sense on the first viewing of the movie, and the audience shouldn't be forced to watch the movie multiple times simply to understand it. I found it enjoyable (but long) AND understandable on my first viewing. Although some things make more sense if you see the movie a second time... but that applies to any movie of substance.So just saying this movie has some very un-common time concepts that could leave some people confused / dis-satisfied with a single viewing. I found them trippy and mind-expanding on the first viewing. Only you can decide how much time your mind can take!I haven't said too much about the plot (I think) or the characters. The plot is basically hero saves the world from the villain, but the villain is ""bank-rolled"" by an un-seen future maniac (who is literally committing global suicide in hopes of survival). The characters are portrayed very well by the actors, but there is so much else going on with the movie, they get little development.In summary: a long movie too confusing for many audiences in a single viewing and with minimal character development after infinite viewings. But great cinematography and action through-out. Regardless, a fresh look upon conceptions of time."
" Decent
",RXiong08,7,23 April 2022,I'd rate this a 7.7 but IMDb won't allow it. This is more of a story film than a character film honestly and very action packed. There's the whole temporal pincer thing that's really confusing. This movie in general is pretty confusing when it comes to the concepts of time stuff but I enjoyed the movie and Robert Pattinsons Niel character is also done pretty well and as John David Washington. With Niel eventually meeting his fate of dying it's revealed that the whole timeline that they are in is a temporal pincer for the protagonist and Niel reveals that he is from the future and know a Niel for a long time and it's a really great scene for both characters.

" Fantastic movie
",kevinbrown-2,10,14 April 2022,"I will say only this: if you *understand* it, you will love it. It tickles the intellect in a way few movies will. If you didn't, you probably won't. I did have a head start though. I read a Culture novel by Iain M Banks many years ago that had a similar plot device. And that book was awesome too. :-D."
" My expactation were too high, but decide for yourself
",valentinwulf,7,13 April 2022,"Directed by Nolan 3 years after Dunkirk, my expectations were skyscaper high especially after the rumors about the plot making the rounds.Unfornutelay the whole inversion thing was a bit too much at times. And most of the time more confusing
than beneficial in a way i cant put in words exactly.See it for yourself, itÂ´s worth a shot atleast!"
" Batman begins and ends and maybe begins again
",jfictitional,7,13 April 2022,"In my review of Dunkirk, I praised Christopher Nolan's commitment to getting original ideas on movie screens. I probably should also have mentioned his commitment to keeping movie theaters open, because if there's one movie that should be seen in engulf-o-vision, it's definitely Tenet. Not just because it's a defining example of Nolan's idiosyncratic crafting of visuals and sound to create an awe-inspiring spectacle, but you can't pause or turn on subtitles - and thus have no time to stop and actually wonder what the hell it is you're watching.I could argue, like many have, that this is Nolan's take on a Bond film, but he's so determined to complicate it with heady concepts and off-kilter action scenes - trying to turn substance into spectacle - that any logical throughlines are quickly obliterated. The plot ultimately does make sense on its own terms, but the telling of it never engaged me the way his best films have while also feeling like puzzles to be solved. It's more exciting than Dunkirk, but somehow even more impersonal, because this time Nolan can't hand wave away his weaknesses with characterization. Not giving John David Washington's protagonist a name seems like an in-joke until you understand it's indicative of how little anyone was interested in him as a human.Once again the actors are the ones bringing these archetypes to life, yet Nolan continually undercuts them with mountains of exposition needed to make sense of anything, to the point that few if any impressions are made. Elizabeth Debicki gives her rather thankless role everything she has, but the clear MVP is Robert Pattinson, infusing his sidekick with a dash of wry humor the film desperately needed to offset its crash-course intellectualism.To be clear: there are few directors working today with the level of inventiveness and sheer craftsmanship that Nolan has, which can never not be a good thing. But it has come at an increasing cost of anything recognizably human, and when I said that was a compromise I'd accept up to a point, I hadn't yet realized Tenet comes dangerously close to going past that."
" A Time Travel Story That Makes Sense
",Minocencia,9,12 April 2022,"A thoroughly thought-out and convincing story from Christopher Nolan once again. Tenet is the only time travel story I have ever thought makes any sense.Nobody can change the future! If it happened in the past, your root world should have already experienced your actions in the past! Right? You can't just go back to the present day and find a completely different world!Basically, ""What's happened's happened."""
" Missed opportunity
",aykutyekeler,4,10 April 2022,"This movie could have set a benchmark like matrix and change the movies like it did forever, but unfortunately its a hot mess, hard to follow/keep up. Granted it pushes your minds limits but not like matrix, which you could understand even watching it once (maybe not all of it but still) Tenet, you need to study it to understand it, and that makes me bored. Unlike matrix it looses its charm once you see it or as soon as you figure out the twist, and i dont have the desire to see it again. Whereas the more you watch matrix the more you want to watch it again."
" Nolan out of his mind. Pretty with action and effects.
",magguilmot,4,9 April 2022,"Wow ! He really went Hollywood this time. Wrote the thing on a post-it. Good actors and effects, a semi-ingenious twist on time-travel that he worked on alone and botched miserably.I love Nolan, he proved he could mix action with grace in Batman; but he can mix it with nonsense and spywork and bitterly disappoint. If I wanted a Transformers- like movie, i wouldn't watch his. But that's what you get here. If he was miffed about being too smart, he erases his tab in one fell swoop with this utter idiocy fit for studio heads and people who value effects or surface.It begs to be smart, but is just at the ankle of CW level. People usually fill the blanks to make it fit. It's so far-fetched that you can't. Take it or leave it . I've tried to like it, go with the flow but I can't. There are no loose ends. That's a relief."
" Lead actor is awful
",moviesfan2,1,7 April 2022,"This film was truly awful and the lead can't act.The editing was also awful, I was struggling to hear dialogue in some scenes. The script and story was also very weak."
" Over-complicated, way too long, and not all that exciting.
",paulclaassen,5,4 April 2022,"Those who liked 'Tenet' said it was confusing. Those who hated 'Tenet' said it was confusing. Having read so many contradicting reviews about 'Tenet' I decided to watch it for myself to make up my own mind.I tried so hard to understand the film by carefully listening to the dialogue and observing every inch of detail. However, I found myself lost ever so often. The quick-cut editing and fast-spoken dialogue made it all the more difficult to follow.'Tenet' is trying so hard to take time travel to the next level. Did they succeed? I suppose that would depend on your views of the film. It sure as hell confused the audience. And who enjoy watching confusing movies? And if your audience is still lost an hour into the movie, there's something wrong with the narration... or Nolan is just such a genius that our puny minds can't comprehend his vision and understanding.Nevertheless, I decided to stuck it out and kept watching. The final our started making sense, and the action sequences were good (nothing mind blowing, though). Once I understood the concept of inverted entropy (not only moving back in time, but also backwards in time), it was easier to follow. It was still way over-complicated.Another big issue for me, was the film's lead: John David Washington, who starred as Protagonist (seriously, Christopher Nolan, you couldn't give your protagonist a name other than Protagonist????). He lacked emotion and for most parts looked either tired or lazy. There was very little enthusiasm from him as an actor. He certainly did NOT make a likable or credible hero. Maybe he himself was so confused that he didn't know what the hell he was doing and concentrated too hard on saying all those confusing lines.The visuals were interesting in the beginning, but during the final act it simply looked like a film that was playing in reverse. In closing, 'Tenet' is not a movie I can recommend. If you want to watch it to see what the hype was all about, then go ahead. But there are far better and easier to understand action movies out there. And to sit through this for two and a half hours is exhausting.Christopher Nolan's 2000 movie 'Memento' was far better. This was also an interesting concept where the story was moving back in time, but at the same time moving forward."
" I cried...bcoz it's that bad!
",TheInfiniteFormula,3,3 April 2022,"I really enjoyed the complexity of Inception and the great idea behind the story. I also almost cried in the theatre after Interstellar was finished bcoz I was overwhelmed by the greatness of the movie. This time, I had a hard time watching this movie to the end. It starts very fast and doesn't let the viewer to jump into the story and it just gets complicated and more complicated. Making complicated plots just for the sake of it, does not necessarily make a movie great even if it's science fiction.Take Pattinson and Baranagh aside, the acting is just terrible. Washington is emotionless and Debicki does not convincing enough in playing the wounded wife. To me, the worst Nolan movie ever."
" Enjoyable movie
",sayed-hasan,8,3 April 2022,"Didn't understand some things. But giving 8 stars only for the ending and cinematography. Especially the last conversation between Neil and The Protagonist was soo heart-touching. A significant line can describe the movie best, ""Don't try to understand it, feel it"". You can enjoy the movie, the movie can touch your heart, but some things will be very difficult to understand. If you try, literally you can feel it! Have to praise the talent of Nolan. This sci-fi film is ahead of time.Not Nolan's best, but a very good movie to enjoy."
" Disappointing
",yrtria,3,3 April 2022,"The effects are good, but the writing is terrible. Almost all of the scenes are predictable and stale, using tropes to advance a lacking story.Lack of backstory makes it hard to connect with the main character."
" Amazing effects and concepts, but plot falls short.
",cjpalmer-53855,7,2 April 2022,"I, like many others, are going to compare this movie to Inception, another mind-bending movie by Christopher Nolan which is highly praised. I for one loved Inception, but where this movie falls short is the overall plot just left me asking ""why? What was the purpose of this scene.""
The visual effects, the concept, score, and the acting are all amazing, and there are some great fight scenes. Overall a good movie. But once you finish the movie I was left feeling like the plot didn't go anywhere.This movie feels like Christopher Nolan had the idea of reverse storytelling first, then tried to mold a story to fit the concept. Rather than building them together, so the plot got left behind the primary goal of exploring this new movie concept."
" Can't hear properly
",inseongsnoodles,4,2 April 2022,Due to the unnecessary dramatic music dialogues can hardly be heard. I watched the whole movie following the subtitles. The concept is actually way simpler than other Nolan movies but they made it unnecessary long and complicated. And the character kat doesn't fit the whole thing at all.
" The best there is..
",dharmharsh,10,30 March 2022,Have watched it thrice.. just go for it.. try not to understand it.. just enjoy the plot.. beleive everything they are saying.. don't question anything.. u ll find it one of Nolan's best creations.
" Don't let others put you off watching
",peteragordon,9,30 March 2022,"So, like many others I was a huge fan of Inception. And like many others I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan. For me, he is my Spielberg, Scorcese or Tarantino.When I first heard the premise for Tenet I was intrigued. When I first saw the trailer for Tenet I was hugely excited.Then I watched it the first time and I liked it but knew I didn't understand it fully. I appreciated the grandness of the scale, I loved the soundtrack and I was amazed having watched behind the scenes how the visuals were done practically instead of with CGI.Having recently rewatched it a second time, it gets better with repeat watching. Something I found with inception. I noticed different things and understood the concepts more. Do I fully understand it? No. Do I need to? As they say in the film, ""Don't try to understand it"".This is a huge, globetrotting spy thriller on a budget normally reserved for a franchise like Marvel or Bond. The fact that this film is a standalone - though there are strong hints at a potential sequel - the world building here is something to fully appreciate.The cons here are small but niggling in my opinion. The sound is an issue. I'm not sure why it has to be so muffled. This is obviously a conscious decision by Nolan and one that maybe he alone knows the answer to.The second issue I have is that despite it already being 2h 30m, I would have appreciated a further 15-30 minutes more of plot or explanation or breakdown. I also enjoyed the time in the world so much that it would have been great to learn more.Do I think this film is better than Inception? No. Do I think that it's a great work of art that deserves to be discussed and appreciated? Yes.It's a film that I would recommend you watching with your phone locked away and with a fresh pair of eyes."
" Boring, lifeless, humourless central characters. Blow it all up, I don't care.
",Osmiumos,N/A,30 March 2022,"I was so looking forward to something special, something as brilliant as Inception.Pattinson is good in the role of Eames from Inception. Cameos by Michael Caine and Martin Donovan are a lovely surprise.But Washington and Debecki play humourless characters that i don't care anything for, so perpetually serious that i just didn't believe in them and realised half way through the film that i was watching them pretend to be these boring, lifeless characters was in fact boring.2 hours in i was just waiting for this to end.Branagh commits to his role as the villain. But the Sator villain role is pathetic and not the least bit credible.The entire art forgery storyline is nonsense and makes the movie overlong.Finally, what was that stupidity with the espresso coffee - carrying it around on a saucer with one hand... why?And the arrogant fanboys saying ""just because you didn't understand it""... good grief - what is there that is difficult to understand?Comprehension is not the problem, the problem is that the lead characters are lifeless and I don't care if they live or die in this story any more than i care about any of the unnamed cannon fodder extras ... which kind of takes away from any suspense that might have been.The concept, the technical craft of film making... impressive.But too long. And the central characters - boring, lifeless, humourless. I don't care, go ahead and blow it all up."
" Meh
",rafequick,5,29 March 2022,"Plot and characters weren't very interesting at all, and the time travel concept wasn't interesting enough for me to want to understand it. Unfortunately, it feels like this movie relies way more on it's gimmick than for example Inception and Interstellar, and doesn't manage to carry the movie.Only reason it doesn't have a lower score is because i watched it with friends and could laugh and make jokes, with the occasional explanation from those who had seen it before.Also, the female lead was terribly written. She was a damsel in distress who was in an abusive relationship and was powerless to do anything about it, all she cared about was her child. I guess she held a gun once which made it okay? It felt like she was in a movie from 2005 and watching it made me enjoy the movie way less."
" A hollywood checklist of criteria combined with Nolan focusing only on the parts of film he cares about.
",syndicateoperative,5,29 March 2022,"This is a film that aims to tick every box in the hollywood propaganda criteria list, along with a few more recent ones; an adulterer (or someone who decided they were in an ""open relationship"") is shown in an excessively positive light, a mentally ill woman is shown as a victim despite being entirely responsible for her own situation. It's so egregious that when this character commits a horrifying act of betrayal against the protagonists of the film, they essentially verbally high five her and cheer her on in a ""you go girl!"" moment.Another oddly excessive inclusion to the checklist is deliberate misrepresentation of violence; chokeholds, chloroforming, and combat in general are shown in a ridiculously deceitful manner - to the point that it just looks goofy (e.g. Someone holds their forearm-only against the wrong side of the neck in a faux 'choke hold').As far as everything else goes: If you've seen any of Nolan's films, then you've seen this one. Music that goes BUHHHH every so often, an obsession with inertia in action scenes, goofily climbing up skyscrapers, etc. He appears to have almost completely given up on plot, story, and characterization. The pseudo-science in this film also doesn't follow its own rules, with ""how it works"" being shown to operate differently multiple times.I'd only recommend viewing this if you want to look at the pretty pictures and expensive stunts; I do not recommend it for the action, however."
" Interesting very poor movie
",roumen-ad,1,27 March 2022,"Interesting because it is the climax of some decadent times when one now could be wonder, how it was possible. I read the reviews hier, some mentioned the bad script and ""the strange actors choice"". Well, that is true, but the more interesting question ist, why it was so bad?I am afraid, I was not allowed to say why it and this is a main issue. I would say, the choice was ordered.I am ashamed, I could give one star to that oeuvre, if I remember which much better movies was given the same by me.I must confess, I could watch the movie the first five minutes but I gave it another hour without following what happened, simply because it happened nothing. Much clichÃ© about nothing."
" Too difficult to understand
",ryanmo-35178,5,27 March 2022,"Like the director much and so excited to watch his new movie. However, to me, this one maybe too difficult to understand. The plot is about time reverse and the later one cannot affect the previous, and with so many theories. I found it not easy to understand and a bit disappointed. Maybe I have to rewatch and rate again later."
" Fun watch, but the time gimmick insufficient to make it great
",bosporan,6,24 March 2022,"The time forward/backward hook is interesting and gives the plot reason to exist. Ultimately though, it is a run-of-the mill action thriller that does nothing to inspire. Elizabeth Debicki performs well, but she is in danger of becoming typecast."
" Nice concept...overplayed hand...
",majoreasy,3,22 March 2022,"Time travel ideas are always fascinating but very difficult to put into a story...It's best when it is one part of the story which affects outcome of characters in minor ways but to be the main story line creates plenty of problems...Firstly...can the viewer follow what is happening and how does one know which time line each segment of the story is showing...having to prove/show/explain every segment in terms of time line becomes bothersome and bogs down the flow of any story...(not a deal breaker yet...)Secondly...plenty of paradoxes to overcome and in a short space of time can be difficult to convince...if not done well, this brings the viewer out of the experience and instead of focusing on the story, the viewer focuses on what the science is and where the script writers got it wrong...and thus missing out on even more of what's (already difficult to follow...) going on...(starting to be a deal breaker if the viewer wishes to follow/understand the story...)Thirdly...can time travellers affect and change history? If possible, then present existence may be pointless because at any time, someone from the future may come back and change history and we know not how that might affect us and all around us on a daily basis...we become NPC in our own life...
Whether this is true or not should be left to expert scientists but for the film viewer, the story becomes less relatable if the point is forced...For this movie...the action and confusing going-ons might be entertaining but the main story line does not hold up...There are too many examples of this to list but let me just give one to illustrate my point...The last part of the movie where the ""Time pincer"" movement is used...meaning one group of fighters move along actual time line while another group of fighters move against actual time line...and together, they 'trap' the enemy at a specific time point...meanwhile, the enemy is moving along the actual time line...Now, it would be ridiculous for the group moving against time line to shoot at the enemy...knowing full well that as the enemy moves forward, the bullets will leave their body and go back into the firing weapon...in that way, the enemy will never be hurt and the group moving against time line is just wasting effort...they will end up the fire fight with exactly the same amount of ammunition than they started with and any damage caused will be reversed by time actually moving forward...Overall, I gave this a 3 rating for the effort and the mildly entertaining action scenes...but based on the story, I'd have given it a 1...having a fist fight with oneself in the past...ha..."
" Convoluted mess
",Old_Movie_Watching_With_Rob,1,21 March 2022,"Looks great but made no sense. Actors aren't convincing and really couldn't follow the story at all. Robert Pattison just looked bored here. The special effects could be interesting, but this wasn't enough to carry the film."
" Brilliant and exceptional
",I_Ailurophile,10,20 March 2022,"Very rare are the instances that I can recall watching a film that felt more dazzlingly precise, and of deliberately obtuse, towering complexity. For all the absolutely outstanding movies that Christopher Nolan has made to date, somehow 'Tenet' still comes across as a new crowning achievement for the staggering excellence of every component part. Every last detail is sharp, vibrant, and invigorating: Magnificent, grandiose art direction and production design. Beautiful filming locations scouted only with supreme artful consideration. Ludwig GÃ¶ransson's mesmerizing, dynamic score - rich, varied, and dramatic, electrifying music that meets or beats the very best of Nolan's frequent collaborator Hans Zimmer. Monumental visual effects, and exquisite sound design. Flawless performances from an astounding ensemble cast. Impeccable cinematography, and direction, and execution of every stunt, fight, action sequence. Terrific costume design, props, weapons, hair, makeup. Attentive lighting.Those are the easy parts. More difficult to discuss is the writing, because there's so very much going on here. 'Tenet' plays in the same space as other action-thrillers, but with a different set of rules. It broaches familiar themes (including one dire message, fleetingly mentioned toward the end) while deemphasizing them, and familiar story beats while twisting them. Beginning and end blend together, and characters' motivations and allegiances are amorphous; the primary antagonist is both an amoral nihilist, and a peerless humanitarian. While Nolan readily acknowledged that the film plays fast and loose with science, all aspects of the screenplay lean ponderously on mind-bending, esoteric scientific concepts that are difficult to grasp in and of themselves, let alone on the fly as they apply amidst fast moving action violence and storytelling. That especially goes for the notion of inversion, a spark of genius that turns the genre on its head by way of the narrative, the scene writing, and even the characters and dialogue, to say nothing of those stupendous special effects. I feel like assessing Nolan's screenplay in depth would require heavy deconstruction of the science involved, breaking down the plot progression scene by scene, and tracking internal consistency with the ideas herein. Very plainly, one time watching is certainly sufficient to appreciate and admire the splendor of the feature - but not nearly enough to completely absorb every slight nuance of so sophisticated a story.It seems foolhardy to review, in conventional terms, a movie that so pointedly jumbles storytelling convention. Some things are certain, however: these two and a half hours are long, yet at that, also don't feel long enough. The dialogue is brimming with intelligence just as the characters are complicated, with hidden depths, and the narrative bears both these qualities as it is tremendously absorbing from the very start - that throws us headlong into the action - through to the very end. 'Tenet' is wonderfully engaging, and stimulating, and keeps one's steadfast attention even if it's not always easy to follow in one way or another. From the music to the acting to the writing and execution of every moment no matter how small, this is a feature that walks recognizable ground even as it actively changes it. I'm someone who has come to realize she's burnt out on major modern blockbusters, yet I watch this and feel a burst of adrenaline that had been sorely missing from its more colorful world-building brethren. The phrase ""blown away"" hardly seems adequate.'Tenet' is as intellectual and convoluted as it is suspenseful, and violent. Those four descriptors should help to inform whether or not this suits the preferences of any given viewer. Those desiring a more straightforward and visceral form of entertainment are perhaps best served looking elsewhere, as well as of course anyone who doesn't wish to parlay with action-thrillers, or exercise their minds as much as their popcorn-plucking hands. Still, the broadly positive reception this picture has gotten says much, and I heartily agree: 'Tenet' is a phenomenal, exciting, rewarding experience that, love it or hate it, I think most everyone needs to see at least once."
" Really Bad
",philipp_auer,3,19 March 2022,Spare your Time and Watch another Film. The film makers think they created a very intelligent and Deep Film but to be honest it Cost a lot of Energy to follow - if one Even can. The Speed of the Plot is much too high and i wouldn't say i Need much Time to Progress. The only positive thing about the Film is the scenerieWouldn't recomend the Film!
" Jason Bourne...
",datamodel,3,18 March 2022,"Jason Bourne on bad acid. It was incomprehensible, and after reading the plot summary I have even less motivation watch it again or to try to understand it."
" Just over the top.
",swatibcharan,9,18 March 2022,"This movie is amazing. I loved it , the story does get a little loose from mind at times but never feels boring. Makes a lot sense when it finally ends, no plot holes seen. Humour was improved by some amount in the movie. Maybe the best performance Robert Pattinson could give ( I have not watched Tha Batman yet).A must watch for every Nolan fan."
" Film Heist Complex Does Nolan :::: Nolan Does Complex Heist Film
",iquine,9,16 March 2022,"Christopher Nolan thinks up yet another unique and complex way to structure a movie timeline. This time rather than a chopped up story run in reverse like ""Momento"" or 4 timelines running concurrently yet at different rates as with ""Inception"", ""Tenet"" has two concurrent timelines: one timeline running forward and the other timeline running in reverse and if that wasn't enough they interact with each other during specific scenes. Of course that advanced structure comes with a complex concept of how and why this is occurring, which revolves around a few people trying to save the world. So the 10,000 purpose is rather common but how that is told and revealed is anything but. To complement the outstanding editing as an awesome music score! Very fitting for the style and tone of movie. I'll leave it at that but as you'd expect the production value is top notch and feels like an epic action/Sci-Fi movie."
" Bit confusing but the music is a vibe
",wosany,8,16 March 2022,"It's a bit confusing and hard to follow sometimes, especially at the Turnstile scenes and climax but the music is a vibe. I was dancing all the way through the opening opera scene. As I'm writing this review I'm listening the music used there. Ludwig Goransson was the perfect choice for this film."
" Not for everyone but still great
",judybrennert,8,16 March 2022,"You watch this movie the first time and it's confusing through out because you are putting it all together.It's super creative and intricate, but if you are not willing to think while watching a movie, you are wasting your time."
" Far-fetched mess with bad casting
",anitatoth1987,5,15 March 2022,"This movie wants to be smart but all it does is to give an over-the-top, far-fetched hot mess to its viewers. You don't care about the storyline after 10 minutes, the score is misplaced, the casting is horrible. I have no idea who thought the protagonist can carry a movie of this scale or that Kenneth Branagh would fit in.I bet the people who greenlit this movie were high on Nolan's latest success."
" The temporal stuff were a bit too much
",aleksandarmladenovskiukim,5,14 March 2022,"The action scenes and the special effects were phenomenal. Unfortunately, I think the plot is overly complicated by the all of the inverted time stuff. The problem with time travel being a central plot device is that the director will have a tough time explaining something that the viewers will struggle to understand fully.The actors all did a great job, J. D. Washington played a sort of ""stoic spy"" who has a code of honor and scruples. Again, if the whole temporal element was exchanged for something simpler, the movie would be streamlined enough to stretch into even more runtime."
" I liked it
",MJB784,7,12 March 2022,"It was a clever idea how this spy who stopped a bomb from going off in an opera house has another assignment called ""Tenet"" where he undergoes training to reverse the aftermath of violent situations after they happen while also altering its timeline so the problem wouldn't arrive. He was stopping a madman whose wife lost their son years ago and is pregnant with their next child from preventing World War III. I'll admit not every part added up. For example, when he was trained to stop a violent confrontation after it happened, the first time we don't know what gift he has to do such a thing, but later he takes oxygen to stimulate his mind."
" Not that complicated but also not that great.
",shcoleman,7,11 March 2022,"I saw Tenet in theaters. Everything happened so fast the entire time that I couldn't keep up with one conversation. Let alone 2 hours worth of plot dialogue. Not to mention, sometimes you really couldn't hear what the characters where saying. Lots of distracting elements that made me leave the movie thinking it wasn't that great and I really didn't know what they just did. I never cared enough to figure it out. But I'm rewatching it now because it's on HBO and why not and I'm not distracted anymore, so I can pay attention to the things I missed. Like the plot! And it's actually not that complicated. Nolan took a theory of science as we know it now and said ""what if"". The future was able to perfect this scientific theory into reality and then started sending inverted tech back in time to create their inverted weapon, which would have a devastating effect due to the scientific nature. It's basically a scientific breakthrough that ends up in the hands of power hungry war mongers; like all the other spy movies. But it's not a bad movie. It's actually a good movie. I just don't think it was the hype it was meant to be. And at the time this movie came out it was peak pandemic season. Hollywood was losing their mind because they thought no one was going to see a movie ever again so they recruited Tom Cruise to help promote Tenet in hopes that people would think it's so good a pandemic wouldn't even keep you away. But it wasn't. And it did. So I think, without the hype, it's a good movie. Just really pay attention to what they are saying; if you can hear them, that is."
" Really awful flick
",JudgeDrake,1,10 March 2022,"One of the worst movies i've ever seen. I coped with it clueless boring movie only for 1 hour. Tenet is bad. VERY bad. The story makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and the motivations for it even happening are ridiculous to the point I thought it was a joke. Tenet is clearly a hommage who it turned to parody,to James Bond movies with a failed attempt at a sci-fi twist but it's mostly a frustrating and excruciating 150 minutes."
" Fringe Fans Will Love This Show
",larry-mcfarlane,10,10 March 2022,"This is not your mom's 'Back to the Future' time travel show. Instead of just magically interacting with your past or future by popping into that time, making changes, and popping back, it explores more of a physics concept which I've never seen before. Some people don't like to think too much when they watch a movie and is what I think contributes to some of the negative reviews. The visual representation of Nolan's concept of time travel will blow your mind if you're into that kind of sci-fi genre. Especially if you loved Fringe. That's all I can say without throwing out some spoilers."
" Would have been better without the time travel
",allie701,5,6 March 2022,"Who doesn't like a good action-conspiracy movie, but add the paradox of time travel including the silliness of speaking backwards, and it slows the action considerably. Throw in entropy and fake physics and it gets even slower. Then replay the same scenes in parallel times and it practically screeches to a halt. I like time travel but cut loose from phony science."
" If Video Game Fetch Quests Were A Movie
",xgarrettstr,5,6 March 2022,"Lets start off by saying the writers didn't even give the protagonist a name, they literally just call him ""the protagonist"". You could only hear 70% of the dialogue because of loud action music during the whole movie, none of the characters were really interesting except Robert Pattinsons characters, and he was done dirty the whole movie. Stereotypical strong Russian bad guy antagonist. The whole movie was based on a time travel gimmick, good concept done poorly."
" The less you know, better it is, but I dare You to try and understand!
",lordarabije,10,3 March 2022,"You can watch this movie in 2 separate ways.1. As action spectacle. There are shootings, car chases, intense semi-war scenes, suspense and so on. If you watch this way, you will have a fun and consider Tenet as solid action movie 7/10.2. As time paradox spectacle using action sequences as a disguise for complex subplot provoking us to use our brains to the max. Only in this mode the movie unlocks it's full potential. You will still have fun, but with occasional headaches worthy of struggle at the end 10/10.Only after certain amount hours spent with this movie (watched it 7 times in 2 months) I learned to appreciate greatness of plot, characters and overall feeling featured in this masterpiece. Will you do the same, it's completely up to you.Tenet is very complex movie to understand. It's not trying to explain itself to viewers, it even seems that it's trying to hide as much as it is possible and dare us to seek and, in that process, stir and shake our sleepy brain cells. Some things and keys for understanding were intentionally left out for our imagination and creativity. Just like socratic method for birthing thoughts in our minds.I understand that this movie is not for everyone, maybe even Nolan knew and counted on that (just personal opinion). I like movies that require of viewers to think, and Tenet is just THAT!Watch it again, and again, and you will surely see."
" FRUSTRATING!...
",Stefan_Loves_Movies,7,3 March 2022,"Tenet (2020) is a PG-13 rated Action / Sci-Fi / Thriller 2h 30m movie. Directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Robert Pattinson &
John David Washington.This movie is NOT something you see every day. Nolan's unpredictable writing comes with another trick to SHOCK the world. This film is more plot-oriented rather than character-wise. Christopher Nolan managed to pull off action scenes on-screen THAT YOU HAVEN'T EVER SEEN BEFORE!The core issue I have with Tenet (2020) is the confusing plot it delivers. I watched the movie twice already, but I still DON'T fully understand what's happening on the screen. The film made me feel FRUSTRATED since I couldn't keep up with the plot.Conclusion: Even though Tenet (2020) tries to be DIFFERENT from your generic repeating clichÃ© movie plots, I DIDN'T get enough SATISFACTION out of it. (7-8 / 10 rating from me)"
" Disappointing
",kaulinmwk,4,1 March 2022,"Positives:
-The movie looks amazing!-Great Score
-Respect to the practical stunts
-Interesting take on time travel
-Liked the endingNegatives:
-The main character sucks like he is so lifeless
-There are times where you really have trouble understanding the dialogue(which is why I say you should watch this with subtitles)
-Very Confusing like if you think Inception is confusing this is on a whole other level
-Honestly the dialogue in general is not the best
-A few plot holes
-Movie feels longer than it is."
" Achievement of our cinematic lifetime
",nikree,10,1 March 2022,"Oh Nolan, Oh Nolan. You beauty.This is nothing short of cinematic feat and deserves recognition, whenever cinema is general is taken up as a subject.I don't have words to express (then stop reviewing!).Just. Watch. It. (Things to watch before you die. Even if you end up disliking it.)-First View-
I was enraged. I went crazy. What the hell, did I just watched.I called my friend to find resort for my incompetency to understand our generation's genius.I was furious. ""What is wrong with Nolan. Am I supposed to get a masters in Physics to freaking understand a movie. Which is ultimately a 'science fiction'.""
Thankfully I am blessed with blessed beings who eventually can at least claim to understand some of it.This made my give a second run. Even without friends, I would've watched it anyway.The movie in itself is so provocative and stimulating is you cannot Not watch it again.Even after the second watch, I can watch two more times. So is the watchability of this great work. And I'm certainly planning to watch it again.-second watch-
I still don't get all of it. But I understood the overall theme of it.Third watch- hopefully I'll get the clear understanding of happenings of the movie.Next watch- To understand between the lines. The metaphors and poetic beauty of it.Basically. This is a gem."
" Time Travel Warfare
",driver84,10,27 February 2022,"This is by far the most intellectually challenging film I've ever seen. I've viewed it three times, and I barely have a basic understanding of what transpires. This is a good thing. I like to be challenged. Props to Christopher Nolan, one of my favorite filmmakers, for proving he is a master storyteller once again. He has raised the bar, or obliterated it? I don't think many can compete with this man, he operates on another plane. This movie is absolutely genius."
" No! Do not watch!
",ztxzffzj,1,26 February 2022,"This is a waste of time, no pun intended. We never get to be invested in the ""protagonist"" or any other character. The acting is abysmal other than a moment or two from Robert Pattinson. The storyline reveals itself far too late in the film so that you watch nearly the entire thing before getting s tiny grain of understanding. I am so disappointed. To compare this to Inception or Interstellar could only work by saying they are also movies. Even Michael Caine must have been embarrassed by this catastrophe."
" Disappointing
",Jithindurden,6,26 February 2022,"Being a long time Nolan fanboy this was very disappointing. It is a good film but easily his worst. I don't understand why he tried to direct this like this was Inception part 2. Inception worked brilliantly because it was inside dreams and it can be confusing along with having an emotional core to it which is missing here. Even though it is related to time paradoxes this shouldn't have been edited like you are travelling through your dream. If there's almost nothing to feel invested in the characters that should be rectified by keeping the rest of it as engaging as possible. Then there is the soundtrack that swallows all the dialogues. From The Dark Knight itself, Nolan had this problem imo but it's getting progressively worse. Even though some of the use of IMAX footages worked in his previous films the changing of aspect ratio between scenes along with the other issue of editing made no sense in this either. Despite all the issues I did enjoy it for what it is, an action spectacle that tries to look smarter than it is and ended up being a dull affair."
" good film
",metehan-72280,10,23 February 2022,"It's a very good movie because it handles a lot of nice details and scientific events in it. Did you know that in the plane scene, the plane actually crashed into the airport and the building at the end of the movie was built 2 times and exploded 3 times?"
" Not rated according to movie, but the effect it had on me
",suyashkrishna,9,23 February 2022,"There are 2 types of people who didn't like the movie.1. Those who didn't understand a thing.2. Those who had high expectations form Nolan.I went with 0 expectations and damn it was a great movie. Not up to the level of Nolan, but quite nicely directed.Time inversion is difficult to grasp if you're not a deep thinker. And the most amazing part of the movie was me thinking in inverse after watching the movie!And on top of that I watched it on 22.02.2022.If you understand the movie the first time (without having any expectations) This is an awesome movie!"
" Good film... you could chop 20 minutes out of it
",raidatlanta,4,23 February 2022,"This movie had some cool premise, some not-bad acting (for an action movie), some ok subplots, some poor subplots, a lot of predictability, good filmmaking...In the midst of all that, I really ended up being bored and wishing the movie would just move forward or end already. I think none of it was due to the predictability, and so on. I think it's mostly due to the fact that i could easily find minimum 20 minutes that I could chop out of this film without it losing any content / substance / ambiance / aesthetics / etc. On top of the really useless bits we could cut out, there are also the poor-scriptwriting ""let me spend 5-10 minutes to explain how this pseudo-technology works even though no one cares because it's a movie-made up pseudo-technology"" scenes that got on my nerves. To be honest, while rating this film I just lowered my vote by a star. Jesus I was bored when I saw this in the theaters."
" See it again!
",Rickardmovie,10,23 February 2022,"I saw it when it was released and been meaning to rewatch it for a long time (I first rated it a strong 7). Tonight I did. This is an absolute masterpiece. What they achieve in this movie is to cinema what the Burj Khalifa is to architecture. Actors in perfect chemistry. Practical effects that bring tangible realism to every scene, a score that becomes an additional actor, superb cinematography and set design, costume and locations are stunning. From the Amalfi coast to the opera house in Norway, all contribute splendor to the screen. The plot sure demands the best of your attention. This time, with the pause and rewind at my own discretion I made ample use of it to cross check chronology etc. And I so far haven't found anything I am not willing to suspend disbelief over. As it deals with physics in a similar way as Interstellar, with time being but a postulate and possibly malleable by the superior space time, then it goes without saying that we cannot truly predict and utterly trust physics in regards to it. Much like a black hole seem to defy physics. If you accept the theories of Interstellar and the tesseract being built by people in the future, then a smiliar scenario is true for tenet. This movie is, however, not to be seen as a tour de force of physics but more as philosophic doctrine. What happens if we can revert entropy? Is our conscience bound by the realm of physics or can it exist in its own bounds? If you watch this movie and not trying to hard to defy the physics but just immerse yourself in the philosophy of it then you might just invest less than three hours of your time and be remunerated with philosophical questions which transcend your temporal experience, just maybe. If you doubt it, spend an hour or so in researching entropy, space-time, singularity and some real ancient Taoism. Give it a shot."
" Clearly Controversial: Mind-bending Movies
",donutgov,9,22 February 2022,"If one thing is clear, it's that Tenet is controversial, and most people either really like it or think it's arrogant trash that's filled with plot-holes.From a personal point of view, I thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through the movie. From the perspective of a bond-like film, it had incredible fight scenes, car chases, stunts, and gorgeous vistas, all while maintaining the thing that separates Tenet from other movies: its SciFi Thriller plot line.About that plot line, yes. It's confusing. It is a tough subject to wrap your head around, and yes. Nolan could have added things or rewritten some parts to make it easier for viewers to understand the whole movie the first time around. I would say there is value in making such a movie as this, however. The first time I watched it, there were a few parts (mostly at the climax) that I was kind of struggling to get because of the timeline and how exactly everything was supposed to be working, but after watching it again and seeing someone on YouTube do an animation of the timeline in that final scene, I understood perfectly. Not everyone is interested in that, but legitimately, if I watched it now, everything would make sense to me and fit, which means that it is possible for someone to get it on the first watch. THAT'S all I think is important. The difficulty to understand something isn't something that should bind your film, because it's a piece of art. This massive project that tackles this really cool subject and delivers in execution extremely well is too good to be dumbed down for the sake of the general public that won't get it upon first watch. Would it be that much worse if it was easier to understand? Probably not, but I don't think Nolan was, has, or really ever goes for accessibility. I think he has a passion for an idea and wants to execute that idea in a fashion that properly conveys how cool this concept truly is. Tenet does exactly that, in everything it does. Several scenes were recorded twice: once forward and once back, and then spliced together. If you thought the movie was impressive before, consider the fact that Kenneth Branagh (an Irish person) had to record scenes speaking in a REVERSE RUSSIAN ACCENT.I think the problem with Tenet was people didn't know how to watch it. Even if you go in knowing it's a Nolan film and that it will be mind-bending, it's not like you have a key for how to watch it to best understand it. So you can go in there, knowing it will be confusing, then be confused and just say ""yep. Shame."" And then dislike the movie forever, but if you had a clue beforehand, you might get the movie ENOUGH (not necessarily all the way) to watch it a second time or be content to say it was a good movie. So with that in mind:When watching Tenet, the first thing you need to understand is that as a largely temporally trippy movie, keeping track not just of WHERE you are, but of WHEN you are is important. The movie doesn't tell us WHEN we are almost ever. It gives us a couple dates here and there, but never of the day of the scene we're in currently. Instead, we're left to figure out WHEN we are based on context of events. I'll try not to spoil it too much, but basically the main idea in Tenet is that there are these machines that can reverse the entropy (or direction through time) of an object or even a person, so in the same way that Tenet is a palindrome, so the story is a palindrome. There is a single event that is the ""center"" of this story, and all of the things that we hear about having happened in the past at the beginning of the movie is the setting for the end, and lots of places throughout the movie are visited twice, going in different directions. There will still be things that are confusing if you watch it and that's what you're focusing on, but I think that would help new watchers.I'm pretty much done, but I would be remiss to talk about the quality of this movie and not talk about Ludwig GÃ¶ranssen's score. This movie's score is so incredible, it actually beat Black Panther in my eyes. Just by a bit, but that's insanely hard to do, and Ludwig really outdid himself with this score. From the motific consistency to the harmonic palette being very modern while also being tastefully retro in a cyberpunk kind of way to the addition of Travis Scott's hard auto tuned vocals adding a taste of futurism to a myriad of the tracks to the thematically consistent reversed strings and orchestras, this score does everything a score is supposed to do. It is able to stand on its own with how good it is. It is unlike anything else I've heard. And it supports the movie so much. Every track perfectly compliments the movie, and I'm confident that the music took this movie from ""pretty awesome"" to a movie that I'm actively excited to watch whenever I watch it because legitimately, the experience of having all of the grandeur of the filmography complemented by the harrowing textures of Ludwig's cyborg orchestration is always a treat. And I think on every level, this movie delivers quality quality work from every department, all the way throughout the movie.Really quickly, one of my biggest gripes with the film is near the beginning when the scientist says that he's supposed to be preventing WWIII, because really he's just preventing the apocalypse, so that kind of misleads you and doesn't seem to fit into the story, but almost everything else in the movie legitimately feels incredible to experience and when you do get it, the appreciation for the film is a lot more (in my opinion) than a film where you watch it, you get it, and you're done.Overall, I get why people would dislike it. There are lots of people that would just like an easier movie to watch and more power to them. It's supposed to be entertainment, after all, and if it's not entertaining to people, it doesn't have some inalienable right to be considered a masterpiece just because it's from Christopher Nolan. In my personal opinion however, it's thoroughly enjoyable for a number of reasons and I would definitely recommend that people watch it if they're up for a movie that will challenge them to think."
" It's just too messy
",Ynocrozplatfom,6,21 February 2022,"A movie with an interesting premise and mechanism, but is presented in such a convoluted and chaotic manner that perhaps even Nolan himself wouldn't get if he weren't the screenwriter."
" Love Nolan, don't love this.
",dan_tench,5,20 February 2022,"I feel this time round, as a lover of Sci-Fi and Nolens time bending movies, this one was a hurdle too far. At no point throughout the movie did I ever feel as though I fully understood what was going on, I carried on none the less and then the movie ended my partner and I turned to each other and both said ""what?"" Even at the end of the movie, we had no idea.As such, we had no emotion for the characters, though this in my opinion is also one of Nolan's weakest casts to date, the main had very little charisma for me and I struggled really to engage with any of the cast.Overall, not one I will revisit and one for Nolan to forget."
" Need to watch a few times to get the idea
",jmpusateri,6,20 February 2022,"Need to watch a few times to get the ideaGreat cast of talent and nicely done special effects, but the plot concept is a little difficult to follow. That said, I suggest watching this movie a few times to piece together the plot which is blurred by the time continuum paradox theme. It is just an insult to say that the editing is too poor or the acting not good enough to save this plot, because the actors and actresses did a great job, the editing works well and the special effects are well done. There are no naked women selling themselves as actors in this moving. The action choreographs for the fight scenes is excellent. So what is not to like? It is hard to figure out who is on first base as the old saying goes. That is why I have to watch this film at least twice to get what was going on. Hidden in all the confusion is a great twist in the plot. Nolan could have done a better job relating to the audience, like he did in Inception, in which the plot concept is complex, but understandable and explained clearly so the audience can follow along. Should there be a Tenet sequel? Actually, I think the main characters could make a very good sequel, but not in the time paradox confusion of this movie. ""aedi eht teg ot semit wef a hctaw ot deeN "" see what I mean? Confused, just watch the movie."
" Slick Film
",samuelobkr,8,20 February 2022,"Fun time. Well made. Great soundtrack. Trippy Nolan storytelling. The first 15 minutes in particular is awesome, it's engaging right off the bat with such a cool setup. Pattinson and Washington are super slick and cool."

",xardashade,10,18 February 2022,"This movie collapsed on its own wits. Since it is way too complex, average audience with an attention span of a squirel and and average IQ can not possible even begin to comprehend how complex it is.For those who were able to keep up or got it after watching several times they know this movie is art.The lenghts they go to genuinely show how temporal entropy works in every scene, tells me how much time and effort they spent to make this movie.Unfortunatelly it is indeed unwatchable if you are average viewer, you will not be able to keep track with the pacing, complexity, twists and unwinding and your brain will melt into mush so you will just watch what you do not understand and find it borring or just stay for the action sequences.Galileo said earth was not the center of the solar system and everyone got angry at him, same as people now are angry at this movie, they are convinced it is bad because they can not process it, the irony."

" Carefully crafted
",amosburton,7,15 February 2022,"Something new. Something strange. Somewhere classical.Tenet is an action movie with a big twist. Not really an SF one. Neither weird-science fantasy.New rule: some objects and beings can move backwards in time. Not ""travel"" in time: just reverse the way time flows. If you start in 2022, in a year, you'd be in 2021.Either you give you buy-in, or you quit. But please note that physics recently came up with very non-intuitive stuff...Then, with that ""rule"" accepted, the movie plays the ""what if"" game perfectly, and is consistent. And that's what makes it great: it has been carefully designed. There was a huge amount of work spent on the plot and script. OK, there are some flaws, but acceptable.Acting is great. Especially John David Washington, who does not play a super-hero, but just a spy 100% devoted to his cause.Music/soundtrack is poor. ClichÃ©.Apart of the ground-breaking ""new law of physics"", the plot is so-so. Very predictable. But OK.Facing adversity, the Protagonist (he has no name...) builds up strategies against something he cannot understand. Just like we have to do facing modern outcome of physics...And that's the takeaway: how to handle things you know you do not fully understand?Don't miss it.

",bdpbib,5,13 February 2022,"Managed to stay with this movie right to the end, but it became a bit of a slog. Sure, some of the special effects were great, but my ability to follow the plot fell away about an hour before the end. I found myself scrolling through social media a few times due to boredom. The wife and kid angle was cliched in my opinion."
" Nolan either stih or sessim with me, this dessim.
",SPZMaxinema,6,13 February 2022,"This movie reminded me a little bit of Memento, which I also didn't like. There's a certain point where mind bending plots and elements get to be so much that they make me not give a crap anymore since I was constantly trying to comprehend/catch up with what is going on plot-wise combined with how/when the phenomenon was happening. It could've been better executed and seemed to be a bit all over the place, although that being said I did like some sequences, some of the dramatic twists/turns, and Nolan's style/cinematography is gorgeous as always. Inception was undoubtedly his best mind-bending movie (which I could actually understand much more) and any other kind of movie of his that deals with complex alternate-reality stuff doesn't measure up."
" BALON NOLAN

",ed-01349,6,13 February 2022,"Very confusing and not the best of screenplay. Visual effects with inverted time look well, but the sound track is not appropriate. Too intrusive and redundant.

Even with Nolan other films with complex premise like Interstellar and Inception, those films are presented in a way that you can still understand.However, this concept is way more thick. I didnt really get the movie and I had to look online to try to get an explanation and it still pretty confusing.Since I didnt enjoy this movie as much with me being lost towards the end I give it a 6.Because even if the plot is confusing, the action sequences are cool to watch and there is a nice twist to it."

" Interesting yet boring
",maatkare0217,5,6 February 2022,"Conceptually I think this movie is pretty clever. The execution was meh. Took me three tries to get through the whole thing. It's a convoluted mess.

At least not in the way it should have been.The irony of the fact that I knew exactly how it was going to end from the first big reveal is not lost on me."
" A Symphony Of Chaos!
",cypherxp,4,6 February 2022,"Another over hyped catastrophe in the same league as Inception. In typical Nolanesque fashion, so much energy is invested in style over substance, with occasional flashes of brilliance in some slickly orchestrated action sets. The acting was clunky, the characters were uninspiring, the plot was unnecessarily convoluted,over promising on premise, but underwhelming in its delivery. The only performance of note was from Robert Pattinson, who displayed some range in his acting chops. Tenet is chaotic at best, and at worst... it is laborious theatrical exercise in confusion that left me feeling hollow."
" Confusing as heck
",on_the_river_flowing,3,3 February 2022,"I know there are folks who really like Nolan, and that's fine. Inception was great, and his Dark Knight trilogy is fantastic also.This movie, however, was not. It was extremely hard to follow, and thank God I watch movies with subtitles because I probably would have been even more confused.Sometimes concepts just don't work out when you put them to a story. Unfortunately, this is one of those movies. It's hard to enjoy a movie when you are spending so much time trying to figure out what is even going on."

The plot is very complicated, concentrate well while watching. At times I think the movie doesn't want us to understand it, due to the audio mixing. The action is good, but I found myself trying to understand what I was seeing instead of enjoying it. The finale is a mess if you understand it on first viewing you should be awarded a medal. Don't watch this as a casual movie viewer, go in expecting an experience instead of a coherent movie."
" Mildly entertaining

In the beginning of the movie we are warned ""don't try to understand the science"" and that pretty much sums it up.Still better than most movies I've seen recently."

" Aspired and failed to hit
",Steelfram,6,30 January 2022,"First and foremost, John David Washington is not ready for carrying a film of this magnitude. A perfect example of why you don't cast someone because their parent is famous. Stop the favors. You don't inherit screen presence and the X factor is indescribable but he just doesn't have it yet, if he ever will. He had one facial expression and it was not riveting, but wooden. I felt a bit like it was an episode of Dragnet (not as good) with the quick and dramatic banter, but the intended intensity fell short and the idea of the story just did not get executed right. Could have been a great film with the right players and a slightly different tack. I hoped for the best and was really excited for this film. I tried to watch it a second time, and it just wasn't any better and I didn't even finish it which I NEVER do. It's not difficult to follow as some would likely suggest, as a matter of fact the predictability was a bit surprising. Really bummed I thought Nolan would knock it out of the park as usual."
" It could have been so much better

Like we understand the concept of dreams, or of space travel and time relativity, but in this entropy nightmare of a world.. it is ridiculous.The action bit, where it relates to the beginning ish of the movie was wonderfully executed, but it wasn't enough to rescue this movie.Some of the dialogues felt like the screenwriters were just patting themselves at the back..."

" Surprising... surprisingly TERRIBLE.
",derek-a-charette100,1,23 January 2022,"Tenet is a waste of 2.5 hours of life. No consistent plot, no character building whatsoever, and randomly incoherent. This is an attempt of ignorant people trying to grasp a complex topic and make a movie about it.So ironic.... people of low intelligence really liked this production because the subject matter of time travel is too difficult for them to understand, and this nonsense astounds them... Basically... they think it's amazing and brilliant because they think it's too complex for them to comprehend.In contrast, intelligent people that have a grasp on quantum mechanics and theoretical physics can easily see that this movie is far detached from what is even theoretically possible. This movie would be legendary if it was written by people that actually understand quantum physics. People of low intelligence would be able to understand it and make sense of it, and people of high intelligence would like it because the study of quantum physics is hugely important and interesting for many reasons.Maybe next time Hollywood wants to tackle theoretical physics, they should call up MIT, CERN, CalTec, etc, and ask for consultant services, and hundreds of students and instructors would jump at the chance to work on a huge movie like this."
" A movie that takes numerous watches to fully grasp
",dmansel,8,23 January 2022,"Man, I don't even know where to start with this.Tenet, the 11th feature film directed by Christopher Nolan, was set to be one of the summer's wildest blockbusters. In an age where sequels and franchises and everything superhero owns the middle of the year, Nolan films stand out like beacons in the dark, signaling that there are still original stories waiting to grab hold of the audience. To state that Tenet is a complete mess of a film could almost be perceived as true: garbled audio, incoherent plot structure, exposition dumps, and mustache twirling villains are abound in this movie, enough to dizzy the viewer and leave some shaking their heads in confusion. However, I fully believe Tenet was specifically designed to drive the audience to the theater for multiple watches to fully grasp and understand all the necessary gears and mechanisms that propel the plot and characters. On a second viewing, details slid into place, motivations made more clear, bonds between characters became stronger, and my overall enjoyment was far greater than my first watch. The audio is still horrible, there's absolutely no redemption for Nolan and whoever was at the sound mix boards.Tenet revolves around our Protagonist, played dressed to the nines by John David Washington, as he attempts to prevent Andrei Sator (certified mustache twirler Kenneth Branagh) from enacting his nefarious schemes. To aid our Protagonist, Robert Pattinson's Neil joins the fray, playing easily one of his most likable characters. Dimple Kapaia, Aaron Taylor Johnson, Fiona Dourif and others also round out the cast, as well as Elizabeth Debicki, who plays Katherine, Kenneth Branagh's wife who I'm still undecided on. Debicki is easily shaping up to be one of the finest actresses of her generation; I love seeing her on screen as either hero or villain, but she's wasted in this movie. There's a lot of her hanging out in the background as other characters do things, but as far as her and her relatively thin motivations in this movie? This role doesn't serve her talents well. Still, the cast is on point, with Washington leading the way playing his Protagonist as a calm, confident, if not at times frustrated character. Many times in this movie we moviegoers are just as frustrated with the lack of overall information as he is. Nolan holds exposition as if it were some sacred creature: preciously doling it out in a small bits, giving us just enough nuggets to string us along as the Protagonist stumbles blindly through situations.The action is top notch Nolan: exciting set pieces crafted by a veteran director and shot by cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, his third collaboration with Nolan (side note: Hoytema also shot Ad Astra, which if nothing else has plenty of visually stunning scenes). Tenet opens on an action scene as The Protagonist is sent on an exfil mission at the Kiev opera house. With stakes getting higher while a ticking clock gets lower, the scene is aided greatly in tension by the score from Ludwig Goransson, a departure from Nolan's usual go-to in Hans Zimmer. Tenet is beautiful to watch, the color design oscillates between a muted palette and bright neon, and the third act (essentially a giant action piece) is a delight to follow as events unfold and refold simultaneously. Is that third act confusing? It most certainly is, but after that second viewing I honed in on exactly what's happening. Nolan swung for the fences and beyond with what can easily be considered as his most ambitious film to date. Remember that third act of The Dark Knight Rises? It's nothing compared to the chaos of the third act here. Nolan will never get to direct a Bond movie and I think the world is a better place for it. That inability has lead to inspired works like Inception and now Tenet, especially as Kenneth Branagh's Andrei Sator fits firmly in the camp of Sean Connery Bond villains.A movie that takes numerous watches to fully grasp (much like his films Memento and Inception), Nolan has created a story that challenges the audience, dares them to keep up with the whirlwind pace, and still manages to delight with bombastic action and tension that keeps you on your toes at all times. That this was eventually (and foolishly) released during a global pandemic that forced the world to take a break from theaters made an unfortunate situation worse: Tenet, a film specifically designed for you to fork over your hard earned dollars on multiple occasions, will go down as one of the blights on Chris Nolan's otherwise brilliant career."
" Aloof and exhausting
",gmaileatsyourlunch,3,23 January 2022,"TENET is a slickly-packaged, loud, exhausting, incomprehensible mess of rapid-fire editing, atrocious sound editing, and a plot that, once decoded, sucks. This is Christopher Nolan fully drinking his own koolaid."
" Nice concept but terrible screenplay
",gangav,3,22 January 2022,The concept is too good but the way the story is narrated is so terrible and impossible to understand. The Director needs to work a lot on the screenplay and the way the story is conveyed to the audience.
" Terrible Movie
",ash-57223,3,22 January 2022,"There's good time travel with thoughtful continuity like Primer, and then there's trash like this that thinks it's smarter than it is. There are multiple times in the film where they deliberately pass up chances to explain how the hell this all works. As if to say, ""we're not even going to try"". That's not ""brilliant"" or ""ground-breaking"". That's lazy. All the criticisms about this movie are accurate. There is dialogue you can't hear because of the blaring of a terrible soundtrack. There is terrible acting from Washington. There is a completely nonsensical explanation for the motivations of the story's antogonist. This movie just plain sucks. Big fan of Memento and Interstellar. This one is a hard no. Avoid it."
" Ambitious, but just annoying
",tommurray-95123,5,22 January 2022,"Tenet sucks ass from start to finish. Or from finish to start, if you prefer. It's just 2hr 30 mins of Nolan sniffing his own farts. The whole thing relies so heavily on its time-flow gimmick to push it as a valid cinematic experience, but the result is a confused mess that constantly breaks the viewer out of the (weak) story, and never presents any kind of development of the characters to keep you invested in them.It's like Nolan forgot everything he learned from making Inception, which is a truly great film. It's fine to be ambitious in your world-building, but it can't swallow up everything else (decent plot, character development, pacing, etc) and still remain an enjoyable piece of entertainment. Inception worked so well because its ambitious world building tapped into something all viewers can relate to - dreaming, and the fluid, often distorted and disorienting reality of dreams. By contrast, Tenet builds itself around the concept of time flowing backwards, which would be wholly alien for us to experience and impossible for us to try and navigate coherently. Is it any wonder that 1) the 'rules' of Tenet's time bending don't measure up to scrutiny before falling apart and 2) make for a confused, unimmersive film as a consequnece.Maybe you can make the argument that Tenet is great art, and that the Oscar for visual effects is warranted. But as entertainment, it fails.Nolan tried to eat his cake, rewind time and have it too."

" Tenet is an intelligent and sophisticated
",ridsidorova,7,19 January 2022,"Tenet is an intelligent and sophisticated techno-thriller and Christopher Nolan's new experience, a film that combines idea and utility. The picture is amazing in scale, completely erases the safe and erected fashionable boundaries with a green screen. The special effects and technical side of the film are expressive and spectacular, and the conventional wisdom of the creators leaves no doubt about their realism. This is a very high level, which proves that no artificial environment can be compared with the naturalism of live action scenes. Separately, I would like to express my admiration for Ludwig GÃ¶ranson. An impeccable choice, and maybe even better than its predecessor in some ways. And perhaps the only minor minus of the story seems to be the dispassionateness of the picture. Perhaps this is how the author emphasizes the equanimity of the heroes of his world. This movie doesn't need a spinning top to set off controversy for years to come, no. In my opinion, the film is purely epistemological in nature and takes a completely unexpected turn. Perhaps the human species, like that algorithm, may be part of something whole or be divided, hidden in different parts of the world. And while this is happening, everyone will be part of this algorithm, only we have not yet realized whether we will be assembled or split."
" If we return to the ""Beginning""
",ridsidorova,7,19 January 2022,"If we return to the ""Beginning"", then the film is more like an open lesson, where the teacher, i.e. Nolan, quite intelligibly and with an excited look, explains the principle of ""lucid dreaming"", shows in practice its implementation, and despite the complexity of this design, it looks very exciting, and open questions really arouse genuine interest, and you want to go to these lessons as often as possible . ""Argument"" is also more like an open lesson and with the same teacher, only the teacher himself now explains the new concept of ""time inversion"" somehow dryly and without interest. And you won't ask him again, and if you succeed, then again his explanations will sound even more incomprehensible and confusing. To feel all this, as one nameless character offers us, also does not work. The scenes that demonstrate this idea look beautiful and creative, no doubt. But at the same time, they do not feel the drive. The film is like a mechanism where each gear works smoothly, without interruption, but they forgot to put their soul into it."

Colossal work, work is felt in every frame. I am delighted and believe that the film is one of the best in 2020. Nevertheless, he will not become a favorite. It has originality and zest, but there is no zest for which I would love it."
" imperfect movie
",daryanik-90653,6,19 January 2022,"Time travel has been turned upside down. In a way, Tenet is a return to Nolan's blockbuster roots, where a smart, imaginative concept reigns supreme. In a sense, it is at the same time a continuation of his later works like ""Interstellar"" and ""Dunkirk"" with little convincing attempts to add emotionality, which simply melts under the heat of intellectual saturation. For me, the ideal will remain films like Inception, which are primarily entertaining. ""Tenet"" is certainly a spectacular film, lively, running forward. It is impossible to take your eyes off the screen, and it is not so difficult to follow the logical chain, at least until the last ten minutes. However, for some reason, in the end, the film left a rather oppressive impression on me, either because of the confusion that arose at the end, or because of the masterfully forcing the atmosphere of the music, or because Nolan went into thoughts so large that they simply do not fit in the framework of a purely entertainment movie."
" I like using my brain, but...
",automon-89390,8,17 January 2022,"Throughout Christofer Nolan's movie-directing career, he has never directed a single bad movie. Now I'm not saying Tenet was bad, but it was his worst film.Tenet has a very interesting storyline, probably Christofer Nolan's most creative storyline in my opinion. Notice I didn't say ""best"". The only issue with the inverted gimmick, is that it can lead to a lot, and I mean a lot of plot holes. Actually, some of the plot holes don't even have anything to do with the story. And you'll never guess what the plot hole is.We don't know what the main characters name is. When I was watching the film with my friends, we literally just called him ""the black dude"". And this is even more important, because in the future, he created the inverted objects.Christofer Nolan's worst film, Tenet, is good."
" Progressively better

" Worst Nolan
",nathanrmahoney,5,15 January 2022,"The acting, script, plot-this movie is just bad. This doesn't seem like a Nolan movie at all. The story is incomprehensible, due in part to the storytelling, but also to the mumbling actors. I had to read subtitles. I'd rather read a book.I couldn't tell you the plot or motivations of any of the characters at any point in the movie, and I have no compulsion to watch it again. The characters are boring and the lead actor is a poor fit. The supporting actors are lousy, too. Pattinson and Branagh are great actors, but not here. The dialogue would fit a braindead summer action movie or random tv series. One last example of how stupid and cringey this movie is: the scene in the warehouse between Branagh and his wife, when she pulls the gun on him and talks about being a tiger. Lol. Then he fake spits on her and she spasms like she's hit with a taser. Lol. No way Nolan made this. There must be another Christopher Nolan making movies."
" A lot of love; a lot of hate
",jramza-1,7,15 January 2022,"Ok, so I've read the scathing reviews as well as rave reviews. My dilemma? I agree with both. I liked the movie. It's not a masterpiece. It's obsession with complex physics temporal/time displacement and parallel universes is at times irritating, and not very accurate (as others have noted), but ultimately necessary for the story line and conclusion. The dialogue track is indeed abysmal- characters often mumble, talk too fast, or talk behind masks. I highly recommend watching this movie with English subtitles. You'll even have to rewind at times- you can't read fast enough to keep up. Sometimes the subtitles even say: inaudible chatter. People say you need to watch it multiple times to get it. You don't. But you may want to watch the last 3 chapters over, as I did; It helps to clarify the actions of dopplegangers/""twins"", and why the movie's obsession with physics, matters.The movie forces you to think, to keep up. If you just want to enjoy a good action flick, as action goes, it's not that great. I prefer movies with new actors, with actors I've not seen before. But I'm not sure these actors were quite up to the challenge of a movie this complex. Music was unremarkable. It's a good, thought-provoking movie, but not a masterpiece."
" The more you watch it the better it is

Third and fourth time you're admiring the cinematography and listening to the music score and how it's all beautifully synchronised. Fifth time you know everything by heart and can enjoy each sequence. You might spend sometime researching the timeline on the internet but ultimately it's an artistic movie intertwined with entropy and time inversion."
" Piece of overrated Trash!

" Incomprehensible
",pd-19490,4,12 January 2022,"Maybe I'm dumb but there were long stretches where I wasn't sure what was going on in this film. It's technically well made and there were cool elements (inverted objects etc) but it got to a point where I was mostly trying to figure out what was going on instead of being emotionally invested in the characters. If you need to include a large amount of exposition to try to explain to your audience what's going on in your plot and most people still don't understand it, then you've made your story too confusing. I shouldn't need a physics degree to understand the plot of a movie. It was frustrating to watch and I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it in a theatre last year. I watched it on HBO Max with subtitles and I almost quit halfway through."
" Consequences of an Unrestrained Director.
",camsft,3,11 January 2022,"Apparently the director burnt some two hundred million dollars making this beautiful Eton mess of a movie. Destroying jumbo jets, blowing up buildings, trashing numerous vehicles, sequstering the Plant Nine mega yacht, horsing around on professional racing yachts, recreating Operation Desert Storm, and then, dousing the whole lot, not in Old Spice, but in special effects.And unsurprisingly, the precious storyboard suffered, its almost as if the director was literally running amok.This movie reminds me of those super high end night clubs, amazing decor, amazing cocktails, and equally amazing sound system - the experience should be great right? But then at some point in the night, we are introduced to a supposed music god, some overhyped superstar DJ at the decks... entertaining himself with all his musical gadgets, not letting good songs finish, introducing totally unrelated songs, adding in bizarre sound effects, not mixing anything to tempo, drowning people in smoke and explosions, scratching up all the records ....I think you get the picture, too bad the movie doesn't come with the cocktails."
" Read a book instead
",paulscott-18340,4,11 January 2022,"The film has some really enjoyable characters, the music is great and there are some fantastic action scenes (some bad ones too).But the big downside is that the overall the plot is overwhelmingly stupid. Impossible to follow, unrealistic, and with poor dialogue. My advice would be to save 2.5 hours of your life and read a book instead :)"
" Rewatch it: Nolan being Nolan
",dockentrell,8,11 January 2022,"First off, if you picked up your phone at least once during this movie just move along. When I first watched(at a drive-in theater(thanks covid)) I was disappointed.. The sound was inconsistent, so many moving pieces, and Nolan doesn't hold your hand through it, so I couldn't quite grasp what was going on and I really wanted to.BUT I didn't hop on here immediately after seeing it to trash it due to my own misunderstanding. I got it at home and watched it a couple more times with the assistance of some YouTube videos/Reddit/the rewind button. Gotta say, this movie is pretty genius.Not along the lines of Inception but how could you not appreciate a concept like Tenet's?? Time travel has been done a million times over, but not quite like this.. I'll say what I think is cool and wrap this up, just rewatch it.-Edwar- I mean Neil, was the true hero in this movie..*sheds tear* Everything he does is clutch but I mean he was basically given a detailed cheat sheet tucked in a Manila folder labeled ""Tenet events"" so there's that. Me?? I would've quit Tenet once I saw, ""You kinda die in reverse but thanks bro""-The Slick Protagonist orchestrated every event you see without him actually knowing it yet. No more Brooks Brothers! Also, sliding a cheese grater across your face, how you feel?-Kat has always been the woman she envied.. She gets shot with an inverted bullet and still manages to clap up Sator on her own time. Savage. (ALSO IS MAX NEIL!?)-Sator is an inverted demon, perfectly performing planned pincers(my god that highway scene). Still, trying to destroy the world and hitting/shooting/trapping your gorgeous lady like that? Not cool-Michael Caine sitting back enjoying his meal comfortably while briefing the protagonist because he knew that the fact they were sitting there means they already won!? ""Box this up for me?""It has flaws, yes, but once you understand the perspectives and events, you might just love it too."
" My favorite Nolan
",rblamanna,10,10 January 2022,"For me this is as good as it gets. Richer with every second I spend thinking about it. If you like sci-fi and you like Nolan, watch it again. Then think about it while taking a walk. Then watch it again. It's mesmerizing."
" Crazy Confusing/Amusing
",donkrishna-dk,9,10 January 2022,"It is like seeing Inception but in whole other concept. Crazily confusing but also Amusing. I don't know how exactly they combined the past and current shot but at several scene I feel like the actors made ""manual"" inverted movement (not done by CGI)"
" Complicated but it makes some sense at the end
",rfmax-64286,8,10 January 2022,"I personally enjoyed this film, (Spoiler) and I especially loved near the ending when the main character realizes that his future self and the future Neil has been a part of the entire journey, and that Neil knew that the world would saved after all. The movie includes a complicated concept in which objects and humans in the near future are able to coexist in presence. I feel like Nolan did a good job using this complicated concept to display action scenes and unfold the plot at the end. However, not understanding this primary concept could make the audience lose focus in the story, and as for myself, I had to re-watch a couple scenes to understand what was going on, and I felt the protagonist's encounter with the main antagonist's wife was dull during the middle. But I feel like all of these parts helped establish the plot twisting ending, so I definitely thought it was worth the watch."
" Did You Hear What He Said??
",jakens-40321,8,8 January 2022,"Perhaps I would have enjoyed this movie much more had I watched it somewhere with Closed Captioning turned on. Alas, I watched it at a movie theater. While I found the concept and storyline of the film to be brilliant, the sound design lead to many instances in which characters were talking, and despite my best efforts to focus on their conversations, I could not understand a single word they were saying because the background noise was so much louder than the dialogue."
" Good, not great, but definitely good!
",tsheehan-86345,6,6 January 2022,"How does one rate a movie like ""Tenet?"" Should I rate it based on my own preferences or what I think general audiences should enjoy? It's a polarizing film and I want to be helpful to someone who might want to watch it. I guess I sort of have to just stay true to myself and hope that's helpful. With that I'd say ""Tenet"" is a good movie. Great? No, but good.The dialog is busy like an episode of ""Gilmore Girls."" The actors have to spit out their lines rapidly. This makes scenes feel rushed and unnatural. Adding to this problem is how scenes are cut very close to their essence/exposition. While there are establishing shots in some scenes in others there are not. It makes the pacing great but it makes the experience kind of loose. What I mean by that is that it feels like trying to read the pages of a comic book but each page is attached to a car of a passing train. You constantly feel like the story is getting away from you and you get almost fatigued from intense focus. All this not withstanding, whether you like it or not, important scenes will get past you and that is not a great feeling.The scene where the bullets have to be intended to be dropped before they can reverse entropy has similarities with ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure."" It's subtle enough that the comparison is not obvious but that bit of silliness is hiding beneath the surface. In ""Bill and Ted's"" all they needed to do to place something where they needed it was to merely intend on changing it in the past and VOILA it was there! The Protagonist is told to interact with these reversed arms out of instinct. This was reminiscent of another Nolan film ""Memento"" where a different type of memory is triggered, ""know how,"" when a physical action is done enough (burning the poloroids). While I'm on similarities to other Nolan films the notion of a hiest has become all to common in his movies now. This is the mark of a storied career but may also show difficulty stepping out of his comfort zone when pushing the narrative in his story. I've heard him mention ""meeting narrative demands"" before in reference to why time is a ubiquitous feature in his films but one's hand is not always forced. Indeed, at this point in his career he is the one pushing time into his films. Don't get me wrong I absolutely love it, but let's not pretend it's not his thing either.The mystery of how the world could come to an end is compelling but hiding the ""how"" question's answer comes with a cost, namely the price is tension. Because through much of ""Tenet"" we don't fully understand the threat we can't feel the need to see the Protagonist meet his goals. At one point I thought it was fascinating that I could not comprehend how the Protagonist could stop the end of the world because I didn't even know the problem, I just had to trust that he could stop these forces from the future from doing whatever it is they do. That curiosity is great but I was so far in over my head that I had to let the threat just wash over me because after all I couldn't understand it anyway (this part of the human condition is actually alluded to later). I believe Nolan tried to fix this with a very threatening antagonist and a score that helped me feel the threat as immediate. However I'd liken it to nuclear proliferation in the post Cold War world: I can't be expected to remotely be able to track something like that so I spend no time worrying about it even though I'm told I should be very worried about it (again all of this is alluded to later). In short: rather than the audience hanging on hoping that the antagonist will solve and resolve the problem in swift order we are really reduced to a babe in the woods with our heads buried in the sand even if we want to see the truth. Again, like in ""Memento"" we just have to believe the world is still there even when our eyes are closed.Now one can blame Nolan for supplementing the confusion with a doom inspired score. It is beyond effective, but I'd say it's too effective. The greatest thing about ""Tenet"" should be its rewatchability but alas there is a problem here as well: between the mental energy and stress one feels from hearing the gripping music and deep base of engines and distant explosions ""Tenet"" is stressful to watch. I'm not sure I really can come back to watch it that often. It takes something out of you.When the Protagonist enters the version of the world going in reverse entropy, the blue time frame, he's inverted and we are seeing what he sees. To this point we have seen several temporal interlopers as well as some bullets, vehicles, and many other things in a reversed entropic state. Now we are seeing the Red enter the Blue and the entire world is reversed entropy for our main character. The Protagonist is warned not to come into contact with himself or annihilation. This is a further hint of things to come and is letting the audience know what is ultimately on the line. This is Nolan at his best. He wanted us, the audience, to experience being inverted, not necessarily seeing time going in reverse. This, again, is similar to ""Memento"" where the narrative is told in reverse but only so we can experience short term memory loss. Additionally this has similarities to ""Twin Peaks"" and the Red Room. Everything except the main character, Agent Cooper, is reversed. It's a fascinating little cinematic experiment. Well ""Tenet"" dials that up by about fifty. The best way to experience this movie at this point is to experience what Nolan wants you to experience, he's trying to give you a feeling you've never had before and it is truly edifying to his audience.A note on the time line: The Protagonist is such for several reasons but an important one is that we see the story from his time line. When ""Tenet"" begins we are in the ""red"" timeline or more accurately the red entropy. So The Protagonist's timeline runs parallel with the red entropy. When The Protagonist enters the turnstile he goes into the blue entropy but temporally speaking is still forward for the protagonist yet is a reverse timeline. So, like the trains going in two directions at the beginning, so are the two timelines. During all of this the Protagonist is going forward. Simple enough, well, except one thing: the second turnstile. The Protagonist has now re-entered the Red entropy but earlier in the red timeline. So after about half way through the second act The Protagonist's timeline, while still forward, is actually behind where we begun at the start. This means things are still being manipulated by a force in the future. What is that force:WARNING SPOILERSThat force is The Protagonist himself. As it turns out the movie ""Tenet"" is about one big temporal pencer devised by The Protagonist. We are told much of this at the very end. What is really interesting though is that the antagonist is dying and is going to take the world with him. The Protagonist passed a test at the beginning where he was willing to die to save others. This played out with the two trains going in opposite directions while a fight was on for the silver suicide pill that will come in later.So, as it turns out, The Protagonist is named as such for several reasons: we are following only his timeline, ""Tenet"" itself is about his temporal pencer strategy, and finally his unique position makes him the only possible protagonist as no one else has access to all the elements of the world. On that final point he is speaking to a character that asks him a question and The Protagonist responds, ""divided knowledge"" to keep him in line but in truth no one knows enough to be the protagonist but The Protagonist himself. Finally we learn that the protagonist is also posterity which is future generations. The final scene is him wrapping up all the loose ends and he did so from the beginning to the end."
" What a mess...
",phlexss,3,5 January 2022,"Don't feel stupid if you can't make sense of Tenet.....because there IS NO sense!For me it's clear Nolan dreamt up something called ""time inversion"" and how cool this could look in a movie. Then he spent 5 years trying to work this into a coherent script for a movie.....and failed! Even making the dialog very hard to follow as some sort of cover-up was not enough to make this work.This is so far beyond anything credible, the term ""science-fiction"" would be to much honour and only ""fiction"" more or less applies. I just call Tenet a ""fantasy"" movie.If very early on in the movie you are told: ""Don't try to understand it, just go with it"" you know it's going to be bad and nothing credible will happen. That's fine if you know you are looking at a fantasy movie but for a movie from Nolan that takes itself so serious it's quite bad.There are so many plot-holes in it which have all been talked about in these comments. Although I don't know the term ""plot hole"" really applies because for that ""hole"" to exist there would also need to be a ""plot"".I remember being said it would be very bad to run into yourself in a another (reverse) timeline.....but he does and nothing happens.The final fight scene made no sense to me: I had absolutely no idea who was fighting who and why? Just a number of people running and shooting and blowing stuff up.I could go on but I'll leave it at that. Others have already said it.I won't be watching this movie again."
" No Character Development
",rallder19,6,4 January 2022,"Overall, I was bored. Don't get me wrong, the action is great, the VFX are great, the visuals are great, the acting is great. Where I became a little lost was the writing.I don't mean it the same way people say they don't understand ""Inception"". As in it's not too complex to understand. I mean it in exactly the opposite way. They drop you right into the middle of the story without really ever explaining the character's motives or who they are really. You get the basic idea. What they want.. what they're after.. but you don't know enough about the characters to know why they want it..I've told people that I thought the character development left much to be desired and occasionally I get the response, ""I thought they did a good job explaining the characters.""I then ask them, ""if you thought they did a good job explaining who the characters are, tell me the main character's name."" I ask them this because we never get to know him well enough to know his name. He is simply labeled as ""protagonist"".So, that's my review. I give it a 6/10. All points go to visuals and acting."
" Underrated
",vklchck,10,3 January 2022,This film deserves a much higher rating than mid 7's. That's all I got to say :) now just filling in the space for IMDB. Blah blah blah. Great great film.
" Don't bother.

" disorganized version of Inception
",johnsmithjanuary-20081,4,31 December 2021,Far too convoluted and chaotic at times throughout to make for an entertaining film. The type of movie that always makes for a great trailer but the actual film inevitably falls short.
" Enjoyed it....a lot
",bmiller59,8,31 December 2021,"But I didn't get it. We WILL watch it again. So much going on and as many times as I read the synopsis, I still did not get it.

I'll lower the bass on my Bose soundbar. The cast was exceptional.Yea...will see it again soon."
" Nolan is officially certifiable
",MFC9,7,30 December 2021,"Unbelievably complex and genius in parts is the verdict. Probably requires a second viewing, if only to take everything in. It's not as complicated as people are making out, but exhausting to watch. Washington is an admirable but pale imitation of his old man. Pattinson has become a genuine movie star. And Nolan is officially certifiable. 7/10."

",hyildiz87,7,30 December 2021,"Although the acting is overall mediocre at best and bland in certain moments, Robert Pattinson does an excellent job. Not only with his character but also showing that he was really enjoying his role."
" Nolan can do really good movies and really bad movies.
",ritera1,7,29 December 2021,"Bad: The last Batman
Good: InceptionApparently some of the science of Interstellar was accurate. But then he had that ridiculous bookshelves thing at the end.I'll assume that his ""science"" in Tenant was consistent but sure was not user friendly in terms of tracking such. I can usually dissect the steps in a movie but not this one. Just very fast dialogue, much of it muddled.The endgame of the clichÃ© bad guy was weak. Nolan is apparently a big James Bond fan and Branagh's bad guy was a xerox of all those. One of those time machines in storage?Some good action. The airplane crash farted out. The hand-to-hand fights were good. The freeway chase was acceptable.I had seen going back in time like that in one other movie. But the whole inversion thing got muddled and buried."
" Highly overrated
",forpassord,4,29 December 2021,"The movie seems a bit confused by itself: It mentions both a WWIII, and a completely other form of Armageddon (without saying anything more to avoid spoilers). And the claim ""Armed with only one word, Tenet..."" in the description of this movie is not correct at all! The movie also wants the viewer to accept that in the future people in principle choses to cut of the branch they sit on when they find themselves on a limb (to say it in a way that do not spoil anything). In a way people in this movie makes a similar erroneous conclusion as people made in ""The Tomorrow War"". ""Explanations"" for things is mostly on the level of: We do not know why, so do not think about it... In my opinion, the ability to make unbelievable things believable is among other things what sets really good Si-Fi writers apart from the others. This movie almost makes the believable unbelievable...Some reviewers write about the ""time traveling"" in this movie as if it gave the movie an unusually intelligent plot, even if those events in the movie is mostly the same things happening in real time and backwards, but simultaneously... To me the writer and director seemed to have time going in all directions at the same time sometimes. Things might have looked great, but at the same time made events messy and confusing.Time travel related stories have been made much better in movies and series like ""Terminator"", ""Star Trek"", ""Back to the Future"", ""The Butterfly Effect"", and even in ""Futurama"" than in this movie. Also in the game ""Dishonored 2"" in the mission ""A Crack in the Slab"".So all in all I found the movie visually stunning at times, but with highly overrated plot and reviews. The way time is mixed together is potentially ingenious, but far to messy executed in this movie. Watch it if you like ""form over function"" in a movie, but do not watch it if you need things to make some sense."
" The viewer has no way to win with this one.
",SAR2019,N/A,28 December 2021,"As I was watching the movie, I took a piece of paper and started drawing the timeline. From the perspective of the good guys, the storyline has two big loops (like a chain: one for 7 days and the other for about 10 days; they overlap a few days) and one smaller loop. The small loop (like 8-10 min) is in the second big loop done by Neil during the explosive ""recovery of the algorithm"" scene. The far ends of the two loops are the two ""temporal pincer moves"" by two different teams: bad guys first and good guys last. Based on what Neil said at the end, there is another even bigger loop, like months/years long maybe, that envelopes the two big chain loops; but, it is not shown in its entirety in the movie timeline. It is because of this bigger loop that Neil knows all about the lead guy (his favorite drink etc.).For all the viewers who comment that they could not follow, it is not on you! It is on Nolan's less than spectacular directing.No. Nolan is not above average in his cognitive capabilities or his intellect; especially if it took him 5 years to write this script, as they claim in the media.In my opinion, there are five major issues with this movie:1) The lead actor cannot act! He has a ""deer in the headlights"" look on his face the whole time. He single-handedly makes it impossible for the viewer to care or be motivated to understand the movie. I believe casting him as the lead actor was the biggest mistake by Nolan in this movie. Not the only mistake; but the most negatively impactful one. There are certainly talented African American actors out there who could have been cast instead. Just unbelievable.2) The dialogue was cringeworthy. The female lead's comments about her son were just ridiculous (the world will come to an end and she makes a comment about whether her son will also die; something silly like that). She goes on and on throughout the movie. With such awful writing, the viewer is again disincentivized to pay attention - because if you do, you get one cringe worthy dialogue after the other. Truly disappointing.3) Character motivations are utterly lacking. There is not a single person whose actions can be clearly, convincingly explained/justified. For the lead guy, this is a work assignment and for the bad guy, ""if he can't have it, nobody can."" For the lead woman, it is because she is a mother. For Neil, he is a good friend. It is not convincing. We may have a very vague idea about Priya's motivation (world domination?) but even that is left to the viewer's imagination and hence, remain conjectural. So, you keep wondering why anyone is doing what they are doing through the entire movie, which only exacerbates the confusion!4) The concept of inverse entropy is scientifically ungrounded, which makes this movie a ""pure fantasy."" This is not science fiction - there are no physics principles behind the concepts presented in this movie! Hence, you cannot rely on prior physics knowledge to make sense of it. That is why the rules of this pure fantasy are laid out by the other cast members through dialogue after dialogue as they explain the lay of the land to the lead actor who seems to be utterly lost the whole time. In fact, the lead actor is so clueless that other people have to keep lecturing him about how inverses entropy and ""time reversal"" works. He keeps asking questions like ""what cavalry?"" ""What is a pincer movement?"" ""What is a grandfather paradox?"" etc. The lead actor is always 2-3 steps behind everyone else (including the viewers) and hence, other cast (like Neil, Priya and Ives) need to bring him up to speed. It is very silly actually - especially the scene when he thought Neil talked. He also acts quite arrogant for a clueless fella.Anyways, because the rules of this fantasy are explained in dialogues; if you cannot hear the dialogues because of the loud, senseless background noise, you are out of luck! Again, it is not on you; it is on the director!I watched the movie at home with closed captions (subtitles) on; and I believe that is how I was able to decode the timeline in one viewing.5) Here is the final nail in the coffin: even though this double loop-in-a-loop timeline I mentioned earlier explains the main story line, the rules of the fantasy are not applied consistently in the movie (e.g., the three leads should have been speaking backwards on the ship when they are traveling back from the viewer's fixed point of view (as we, the viewer, don't get inverted ourselves), the bullet hole should have been growing smaller not larger in the first Oslo incident, they should have been wearing their ""inversion"" masks when going back in time etc.). The movie is NOT self-consistent! And that is unacceptable - especially for a fantasy when the director/writer gets to make all the rules!On the positive side, the fight scenes where the forward and backward guy fights himself were totally cool: the choreography is very neat. But, the car ride scenes were hard to follow because three time directions (forward everyone, ""earlier"" backward bad guy's team and ""later"" backward lead guy).All in all, this is not a smart movie as many say.If you pay attention you are disappointed with inconsistencies; but if you don't pay attention you are all confused. The viewer has NO WAY to win! The movie is bad either way. Again, it is on Nolan!"
" 2
",shiafromafrica,3,28 December 2021,"Christopher Nolan's latest head-scratching thriller is a far cry from INCEPTION, although as a blockbuster action film in the Bond mould it's fairly enjoyable. But, like DUNKIRK, it manages to be seriously flawed too, and less good than it thinks it is. It suffers hugely from a lead actor who can't actually act; even the Indian kid from EASTENDERS would have been better. Robert Pattinson, Kenneth Branagh and Michael Caine all act Washington off the screen at various points. As for the time travel, it's more like time reversal, and is essentially a MacGuffin which allows the director to incorporate some cool trickery into the otherwise routine action bits. Not bad, but not a film I'll think much about in years to come."
" Again Nolan
",Cylonpi,8,28 December 2021,"With Christopher Nolan, you can be sure that if you like his style you will like each story he tells.Visually is Nolan, perfection ""en estado puro"".Why not a 10 if I like si much Nolan.Just because the story needs, to me, be visualize several times to be understood.Because I know that I'm missing something."
" Interesting ideas sterilized by unrelatable characters
",gndy-63302,6,28 December 2021,Main character in this movie seemed like some random child-like protagonist of yet another mediocre action videogame. He had simply nothing to loose and the sympathy towards the ill treated wife of mafioso nemesis was not properly exposed or developed in any believable way. Two intensive time traveling salted action scenes (not including the final battle which looked like online match with lags) are quite memorable and are on par with those of Inception. This is however enough only to make a good trailer not a whole good movie.
" A real disappointment
",gg2507,6,28 December 2021,"The movie starts out fast and the first hour or so is quite promising. Looks like a good Bond movie, with beautiful shots in multiple locations and a lot of action. However, it turns into a big mess. The plot and the timeline becomes too comolicated while the movie becomes repetitive and boring. So in the last 30 min I was not understanding much and also not caring much.The main character has no emotions and no background, very much like a robot. That said, it's very hard to feel something for him when the guy himself doesn't show any feelings. Neil was more likeable but he didn't get time (which is impressive given how long the movie is) to showcase much of his human side either. At some parts it felt like watching a military mission, not a movie, because you just couldn't get any time of connection with any of the characters.I love Nolan films and this has been, so far, the only time I felt disappointed after watching one of his movies."

" Hollywood needs Christopher Nolan
",keithcunningham1989,8,24 December 2021,"It's not a remake, sequel or reboot. It's an original breathe of fresh air.The characters aren't overly emotional. This makes them more sophisticated and intelligent.People are saying its overly complex but I would say it's marketed towards a more educated audience."
" A Great Interesting Film
",alindsayal,8,23 December 2021,"So the day has finally come, 5 months after seeing my last film in the cinema, I have returned to watch the new blockbuster Tenet and here is my review for this film. The premise of the film sees a man have to travel the world in an effort to stop World War 3, but he is only armed with a word - Tenet and he has no idea what he is getting in to.Main Character
John David Washington plays The Protagonist here, no seriously that is his characters name. He is really great here, he gives a really strong performance, we follow this guy all over the world on a journey and you will care about him and really want to see him succeed. He has plenty of charisma here and swagger that you buy him as a leading man straight away and will see much more of him in the future.Supporting Characters
Robert Pattinson has had a good week, after the brilliant first trailer for The Batman and now his fantastic performance here. He has so much charisma too, the partnership with him and Washington is the real highlight of this film, they are great together and it is great to see two younger actors thriving in this large blockbuster. Elizabeth Debicki has a large role and I think this is the best I have seen her, her character has the real emotion here, you care about her and want to see her personal story resolved in a positive way. Kenneth Branagh plays the villain, and just like Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit he is playing a Russian and I do think his accent is pretty decent. He does a good job in coming across as the aggressive and intense bad guy and adds to this film very nicely. Himesh Patel and Aaron Taylor Johnson also do good jobs in there smaller roles.Story
Now this is the part of the review that will be really short as I knew pretty much nothing about the plot and that is the way you have to watch this movie. The story is really interesting in different ways that I will not get into, but the film is also really convoluted, most of it makes sense but it is sometimes a film that is quite hard to follow. I think this films plot will be better when you watch this film on its second watch-through.Script
The character dialogue for the script is really well done. The relationships between them is handled well and you do care about the characters and the perils that they are put into. But some of the dialogue that explains the plot didn't really work for me, I mean there was never a part of the film where they dumb the plot down even a little bit and that can again make it hard follow.Style
The style of the film is fantastic, this is a film that was born to be watched on the cinema screen, don't watch this on a tablet or phone or even your TV, if you can go and appreciate it on the big screen. The action scenes are brilliant, they flow incredibly well and the unique story element allows them to get creative and add excitement. Also this film is 2 hours 30 mins long but I was never bored once, the pacing is great and even though this film is long and a tiring watch it is never dull or too slow.Overall
Overall, this is a great Christopher Nolan film, though I thought it was more in the Interstellar bracket of quality then Inception. However, I think on repeat viewings this film could be better and better, even raising the ranking higher so I would implore if you are a film fan and can, go and see this film and support the cinemas as it is worth a watch.Rating - 8/10."
" I feel like Tenet will drastically improve with multiple viewings
",charbelelaro,8,22 December 2021,"Tenet is directed by Christopher Nolan and is about a secret agent who embarks on a time-bending mission in order to prevent World War III. This film makes Inception and Interstellar seem easy and straight forward in comparison. This is easily one of the most confusing films I've ever seen. The first act's heavy exposition was very hard to hear, understand and process in a short amount of time. For me the second act was where the movie really picked up. Although I still hadn't grasped the plot, the action set pieces blew me away. Nolan's unmatched creative mind was really able to shine here. These action sequences accompanied by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson incredible musical score, had me watching in awe. On a technical level, the film is revolutionary. The focus on practical effects is absolutely incredible. In terms of spectacle, Tenet is unmatched. However by the third act I couldn't help but feel detached. This is simply because I was struggling to understand what the characters were desperately trying to stop. I sat there and admired the jaw dropping visuals but didn't feel the all adrenaline presented to us on screen. Tenet is clearly a plot driven film. The characters and emotional core of the story were very underdeveloped, so when watching it for the first time there's really nothing simple to grasp onto. Part of me feels like these are all areas for improvement, but another part of me feels I need to trust Nolan's vision. I feel as though Nolan is deliberately challenging the audience here. He blatantly avoids so many standard film conventions, I can't help but feel like it was all intentional. Instead of the actors, Nolan treats the plot like the main character. That is why the world building surrounding his idea of time is truly incredible. Unfortunately, on first viewing I didn't really understand all of it, and I'm sure Nolan is very aware of this. His intention is for audiences to see it several times. That's why I feel like Tenet will drastically improve with multiple viewings. I'm going to give Tenet an 8/10 even though I still don't fully understand the movie. However my inverted self has seen it three times and has told me it deserves that grade."
" Great concept, not so great in delivery
",dohntagalog,7,21 December 2021,"Tenet's concept on how time is reversed is mind blowing. I'd also say its new to media since I never seen any movies or tv series that uses this concept of time. Most of them just uses time travel and that changing something in the past changes the future. In this movie, everything is already certain and bound to happen. The problem with this movie is how poor the story is being told. Dialogues can't be heard because of how loud the film's score is. I had to watch the movie twice and with subtitles to fully understand and enjoy the film. The final battle wasn't easy to understand too. I could see how people wouldn't understand it. Walls exploding, guns firing and people flying and you wouldn't know why. Although, I was impressive how we were given the ending in the middle of the movie and another perspective at the end.Still a great movie. I definitely suggest you watch it with subtitles and focus on the movie."
" Not good
",martah-50153,4,20 December 2021,"Nope, not what I was hoping for. Confusing and a bit boring. Glad that I could pause it. Managed to finish the whole film out of pure curiosity. If you have spare time to waste on a movie, well, try it out. The good thing about the movie is ofc the scenery and that it looks expensive. Great picture quality. Plot and acting below average."

" A dream come true
",guskeller,9,14 December 2021,"To say the least, Tenet is complex. Some say it's too elaborate for its own good. However, despite turning off certain viewers, the film's tangled plot deserves applause for its detail and fearlessness. Few contemporary films bring genuine originality, surprise, and genre-blending to wide audiences. Christopher Nolan has proven that he can still hit that neglected target. And this is all just on a written level. Yes, Tenet is occasionally dry, lacks characterization, and could have been more streamlined. But those forgivable flaws are greatly outweighed by a riveting story that is both familiar and fresh.Meanwhile, Tenet is a well-rounded film. The sound design has gotten backlash for its quiet dialogue, but that front also provides complex sound effects and abstract moments. The editing is elegant but energized, the acting is strong, and the imagery is grand. The production design is a graceful balance of chic espionage and tasteful sci-fi. The music is sophisticated, ambient, and relevant. The special effects are expertly unique and minimally computerized, deepening their impact and timelessness. Collectively, this creates a distinct atmosphere that is a dream come true. Conclusively, Nolan is a master of making his visions into realities.Writing: 9/10

" Complex but lacks explanations
",jakewilkinson12,7,13 December 2021,"I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan and Inception is top 3 favourite films so I was looking forward to this.However it falls short of what I had hoped for. It is certainly more complex but it is not explained well at all to the point where it is extremely difficult to understand. Inception managed to explain it without it feeling obvious.Tenet seems to make it impossible for the sake of it. The concept of time travelling in both directions is more flawed than concept of inception.It also seemed more of a basic crime thriller with car chases, gun fights etc rather than an interesting story.Overall it isn't bad at all my disappointment comes from high expectations and a 7/10 is a solid film.I am likely to rewatch as often his films are better second time round."
" A great film if you are a machine
",pavlepredic,1,13 December 2021,"One day machines will become agents with free will, living and working together with humans in a dystopian future. When that happens, they will LOVE this film. Because if there's one thing that really bugs machines is how to deal with all that nonsense that humans do: caring, loving, striving, longing, connecting etc. But this they get: there's a gesture and a word, there are bullets with reversed entropy, these are the rules, got it? Now watch this and observe how it's logically coherent. Great, right? What else could a disembodied consciousness want from a movie? Here are the dots, now connect them and feel the satisfaction of utilizing the only thing you've got: your logic circuitry."
" Hamko Hamo
",hamkohamo,10,13 December 2021,"Christopher Nolan's latest head-scratching thriller is a far cry from INCEPTION, although as a blockbuster action film in the Bond mould it's fairly enjoyable. But, like DUNKIRK, it manages to be seriously flawed too, and less good than it thinks it is. It suffers hugely from a lead actor who can't actually act; even the Indian kid from EASTENDERS would have been better. Robert Pattinson, Kenneth Branagh and Michael Caine all act Washington off the screen at various points. As for the time travel, it's more like time reversal, and is essentially a MacGuffin which allows the director to incorporate some cool trickery into the otherwise routine action bits. Not bad, but not a film I'll think much about in years to come."
" Love how Nolan keeps making more garbage this one takes the cake.
",bullerdaddy,1,12 December 2021,"I am both bored, but the same time amazed about Nolan, being able to make worse and worse movies. This one is differently the worst. After 6 tries, I finally saw the movie till the end. And I'm sad to say it wasn't worth it, and will not be for the future. Not going to give that man another change. It's been downhill after the dark knight, and this will continue as long as there is Nolan simps out there.Nothing against him, being creative, and try make new stuff. But let's recognize a dog poop on the street when you see it, and not call it art.. I'm out."
" Average film with an unskilled lead actor that ruins the film.

Well made film and everyone else is convincing but Washington is just terrible. I am embarrassed for him. Who hired this guy? If the producers wanted a black lead, was Daniel Kaluuya not available?Denis Villeneuve would've hired a lead that can actually act."
" A weaker addition to Nolan's film collection
",jakebunker,8,10 December 2021,"I'm kind of sad about how this movie turned out. It probably would have been pretty incredible, if the movie had taken like another half hour to explain everything clearly in the story. There also isn't as much ambition or character in the actual characters in this movie, they all just kind of play their parts and then they are out of the picture until their next scene. The visuals and filmography though are something to be admired. To see something forward and backward at the same time blew my mind away and I was in love with the idea. It's just a shame the movie was a bit oddly paced and not too captivating to make me enjoy it more than I did. Absolutely brilliant idea, just not the best executed.Edit: Changed to 8 stars. I did this because although it wasn't the greatest directed movie Nolan has made before, I cannot deny the quality of several parts. The screenwriting is phenominal; I don't know how one can even wrote screenplay like that. The score is actually pretty fantastic. John David Washington's performance is outstanding considering the protagonist isn't exactly written as the most interesting character. I don't have an issue with dialogue issues; Nolan isn't stupid and it was intentional despite it being not the best choice. So the editing is actually not bad in my opinion."
" A never-ending Rubik's Cube, Ph.D in Nolan Required
",assignbydesign,10,9 December 2021,"When Christopher Nolan introduced Inception and Interstellar, it opened a new part of cinema's brain. If you couldn't hang with those two, it will be nigh impossible to hang with this one. The ingenuity of this film stretches far and wide, from impossible performances to stunts, from screenplay to cinematography, from soundtrack to story arc, there isn't an effort I've seen that can match this one. I guess the most powerful takeaway is one never seen before--the bad guy (Branagh) is the only one who understands the weapon of inversion, and the rest of us, characters and audience alike, are fighting to understand it in order to stop him. Now, how clever is that?"

" What a mess.
",ashleyfitches,4,8 December 2021,This movie felt like a simple plot but was made more complicated than it should've been. I felt like 30 minutes of the movie should've been left out then it would've probably been easier to follow. The acting in the movie was decent not the best though and was left disappointed with Robert Pattison in this as I've enjoyed his last few movies.

",TygrKat,8,5 December 2021,"Score: 8Top Praise: Satisfying ending with all meaningful loose ends tied.Bottom Critique: Not enough explanation of the time-travel mechanics with action scenes used to mask a lack of hard rules.Overall: Very entertaining movie. The time-travel element is a great device which carries the story; I only wish it was explained in more depth, but the explanation given is satisfactory. The story is gripping from beginning to end, and finishes very well. At no point does this drag or feel rushed. The pacing is very good, and every scene feels necessary, which is impressive for a 2.5 hour long movie.Characters: I would have liked to see a few more character development/interaction scenes replace some of the action scene minutes, but overall I enjoyed all of the main characters, including the antagonists. All characters get a satisfying ending.Plot: The overall plot is deceivingly straight-forward. All complexity comes from deciphering character motivations and the time-travel mechanic and it's effects on events. The simple plot is very well balanced by character interactions and everything is influenced by the time-travel.Comments: Everything works in this movie. The characters are likeable (or hateable) and by the mid-point you're left guessing who the real 'good guys' and 'bad guys' are. I would have enjoyed a couple good twists, but I'll 'settle' for a very satisfying ending that leaves no significant loose ends."

Not sure why Tenet got some hate/ mixed views but I think it's genius level film that is probably the most confusing story ever made that probably bothers some. The dialogue is brilliant throughout while being over your head complex which I crave in a movie it's my favorite! Some of the events don't really make sense yet still remains entertaining throughout. Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors of our generation in my opinion he creates cinematic beautiful thrill rides despite anything this film is well worth it!
" A Christopher Nolan Melting pot
",sjbgnmnrqa,5,4 December 2021,"This movie is Christopher Nolan putting all what he likes on a movie but without any effort. Expensive cars and clothes, abstract scientific concepts (with no sense in this movie), a lot of exposition and the worst: a principal character same as Batman, but with no personality, backstory or motivation. The time concept it's interesting but it can't supports a whole movie. I think that Nolan need to comeback to basics and make a movie like Memento. A lot of budget have been making him really lazy."

However, it is also extremely hard to follow, as characters are constantly moving from location to location, with barely any dialogue to explain why they're there. The good certainly stands out, just don't expect a straightforward film."
" ""You British don't have a monopoly on snobbery, you know.""
",BrunoRatesTheMovies,7,1 December 2021,"WOW, it felt so good to be back in the cinema, although, with everyone doing their CIVIC duty, the place was a ghost town. TENET has been on my RADAR for ages, I'd hoped it was on Inception's LEVEL but it felt pretentious, confusing and self-indulgent. Action scenes were amazingly done. I would REFER a rewatch with subtitles, that way you could really feel the WOW."
" Exhausting to watch
",rblafosse,3,30 November 2021,"There is supposed to be some underlying story line about an unobtanium type of material that makes things go backwards. People for the future are coming to the past to do stuff. Why one would ask - if your from the future you know what has happened - so what is the point?Brings up the next question, what is the point of this movie?I was completely lost - if there was a plot, I couldn't find it. There is soft spot in my heart for time paradox files, but all I got out of this was a headache.The characters were plastic, wading through the script like it was molasses. Incidentals such as why things were happening the way they were glossed over, ignored or simply left to the view to figure out for themselves. Sometimes it is good that the director puts forward a question that leaves the viewer something to ponder over, usually a deep moral question or existential issues that tickle the amateur philosopher in all of us.In Tenet, the questions are more like - what is going here? Where did that character come from? Why are they doing this? This make no sense - and so on. Don't bother watching. I tried to get through it but gave up 3/4 of the way through, it was just a dogs breakfast of action sequences, bad acting and incompressible storytelling."
" Way too confusion and drawn out
",roosterpalmer-49009,3,30 November 2021,"This movie is so convoluted with a mixed up plot, confusing to the casual observer, and overall one of those that you're just waiting for it to end. You literally may have to watch it a dozen times for it to make sense and its not worth it. It has no star power and the climax doesnt make sense. Overall, regardless of the special effects, it is too confusing to bother with."
" Interesting idea but...
",zebastian,6,30 November 2021,"It became overly complicated. Don't get me wrong, I understood the logics (or the illogics) and I understood what was happening. But still, it became really confusing at times...Would be interesting with some kind of timeline to study."
" Good enough
",rominospaul,8,29 November 2021,"I'm scared of this movie. Not because it's scary, because it makes me feel stupid.I'm not sure why Nolan insisted on having a needlessly complicated plot on top of a massively difficult to grasp time reversing concept, but here we are. All this movie needed was a simple plot with personal stakes with a time reversing aspect."
" Overall... ""meh""
",breanne12,6,29 November 2021,"About the only thing I enjoyed in this lackluster movie was the special effects, which there wasn't a tremendous amount of. The writing was bland, the acting was quite average, and the story was disjointed throughout the movie. It was hard to figure out what was going on, especially when there wasn't a flow between scenes.Was it enjoyable? Moderately, yes.Is it a movie I'd watch again? Nope, not very likely."
" Nolan you are a boring director who knows nothing about action
",mussie-67780,3,28 November 2021,"The bad: This story is completely silly and a complete mess. And it's too long. (2 and a half hours!) Let's face it, how long can a director capture an audience with a gimmick of walking backwards through life? We did it as a kid, walking backwards. It was fun then. But making an entire movie about it and thinking you are smart? Who were they kiddin'?More bad: let's not even talk about the ridiculous editing pace of this movie. A simple conversation between 2 persons is being cut as if it were an action sequence. The actors AND the acting aren't very impressive either: lots of silly accents (Robert Pattison with his ""English"" accent) and lots of B-actors without real charisma.The good: This movie is really intrigueing at the start. And quite exciting as well. There is lots of frenzy like action from the get go. Although I didnt understand anything that went on, from the very beginning, it all looked quite cool and fascinating. Not understanding can be interesting...More good: the movie looks beautiful. The design is impressive. Some of the camerawork is pretty classy. There is also a frenzy like feel throughout this movie, which I liked.But in the end this movie is a gimmick that failed. It's a wannabe smart movie,that upon closer inspection is rather silly..."
" Noise!
",gtbarker,6,28 November 2021,Can we please have a film without constant noise over the dialogue - all that gimmick does (besides annoy the back off viewers) is prove the makers don't have faith in their product to hold our attention.
" Mind Twisting Time Bending Fun
",nipjcrbe,9,28 November 2021,"This movie is so much fun to watch. It's science is creative and interesting, and its action is satisfying af.This movies re-watchability is through the roof. It's actually better on the second watch, but the first is still awesome.As a technical person, I have no idea how they filmed most of the scenes. It's just so fascinating."
" Not Understandable
",wishbinvisible,3,27 November 2021,Watching this movie is like opening a 500 page book on page 300 and hoping to understand it. One reviewer suggested watching it more than once. No movie should require multiple viewings to understand it.
" Great!
",pt-ramires,10,27 November 2021,It's a refreshment to have these kind of movies. So well thought and executed.From beginning to end your focus in the movie is so high since there's so much happening and so many questions popping up in your head.
" Envisioned Directing by Christopher Nolan Coupled with a Great Performance by Kenneth Branagh in a Smaller Role
",elect_michael,8,26 November 2021,"8 of 10 stars. Many Film Historians have said that Christopher Nolan had Directed 10 Masterpieces before this Film, and finally made a Film that is not a Masterpiece in this Film, his 11th Film, Tenet; they would say this Film is extremely good, but Nolan finally Directed a Film that is not a Masterpiece. I disagree with the Film Historians, as he is 11 for 11, this Film is a also Masterpiece, a truly great piece of Film Cinema.His Direction is envisioned, a truly great piece of Film Direction. Like his earlier Film 'Inception', I'm almost not smart enough to follow his complicated story; but like Inception, my mind is able to keep up with his thought provoking story just enough for it to come together in the corners of my mind and in bold letters written on its back pages.The 3 stars in this Film (John David Washington, Robert Pattinson & Elizabeth Debicki) do a fairly good job, and their performances work just fine. But the truly great performance in this Film is by Kenneth Branagh. He is in a smaller role, but very important role. Branagh puts on a performance that few Actor's can do, complicatedly mixing subtleties and dynamics that can only truly be achieved by someone with a true understanding of the craft, peeling the onion several layers deep in this Film. The 3 stars do fine, but they simply aren't able to perform with Branagh, without being too hard on the 3 stars because, again, they aren't bad at all. Branagh is a great Director himself, and I've always swayed between if he's a better Director or Actor, truly great at both; like Nolan is a Masterful Director, but also a great writer, which is he better at?What would be the order of Christopher Nolan's 1st 10 Films? I believe if I talked with 100 of the most respected Film Historians they would all have a slightly different order, but I believe the consensus would end up in this order, with Film Historians considering all 10 Masterpieces:
1. The Dark Knight (2008)
2. Memento (2000)
3. Dunkirk (2017)
4. Inception (2010)
5. The Dark Knight Rises (2012)
6. Batman Begins (2005)
7. The Prestige (2006)
8. Insomnia (2002)
9. Interstellar (2014)
10. Following (1998)"
" Unrealistic crap
",fluffchop,1,25 November 2021,Why do people run onto the stage to shoot at the start? It makes no sense. How do the cops arrive so quickly. How does the token know where to find the guy in that whole place? Why!? Is this so bad already! Turned it off.
" Confusing
",sake420,6,25 November 2021,The only people that would say they understood this movie are people that think they have something to prove or just like analyzing movies a lot. Most of the movie is just spent with people explaining how the time travel mechanism works. None of the characters have a real personality and they also never really have an actual conversation. But did I understand how the time travel works after most of the movie was spent explaining it. NOPE! There are still things that I don't understand. And this movie would have to be watched multiple times to get everything out of it so that is why I am giving it a 6. The action was great but the plot was not too east to understand especially on the first watch.
" I Get it (NOT)
",Nobbsy,3,24 November 2021,"Forget about trying to understand the ""science"" in this Sci-Fi action ""thriller"". It's all gobbledygook, Just sit back and enjoy the car chases and things blowing up backwards. In my own case, I wasn't able to enjoy it because I kept trying to understand what a ""temporal pincer movement"" is and why the characters are wearing gas masks all the time. One critic had this to say: ""There's something grating about a film which insists on detailing its pseudo-science while also conceding you probably won't have followed a thing."" Exactly! They say Nolan spent ten years ruminating over this story. It wasn't long enough."
" Refreshing
",sreekiee,8,24 November 2021,"I didn't feel Interstellar & Dunkirk were Christopher Nolan's level, but this was refreshing! I enjoyed the time-reversal concept! Though the soundtrack was not from Hans Zimmer, this was engaging too.PS: I got this watching the first time!"
" Sounds not balanced
",greg-22819,9,23 November 2021,"The music on this film was too loud. This made it difficult to hear the dialogue at times. Other than that, I love this movie. I had to watch it multiple times to fully get it, even now, I'm not sure I totally understand it. I really hope that there is a sequel."
" Weak plot. Nice special effects.
",sparkythesloth,3,22 November 2021,"It's by far the weakest Nolan film to date. Barring the psuedo-science, one may find difficulty with an Irishman playing a convincing Soviet villan--not for the bad accent, but the weak character motivation and fabricated violence.The protagonist own motivation for protecting the female lead are equally undeveloped and his own performance likely the worst out of the entire cast.Treat this like a bond film attempting to presume it has a deep, twisted plot believing its own made up science."
" Don't waste your time
",arpi-2,4,21 November 2021,"Messy, dull and shallow story aspiring to be something, but being nothing. Neither science nor fiction. Nether alluding, nor making you to think. Naive."
" The downfall...
",georgios2336,3,20 November 2021,"Dear Christofer,I believe that after Interstellar which was your masterpiece,the downturn has began.First Dunkirk,now this???Get yr s*t together man!!!As for the movie itself:
Very difficult to understand(since the beginning actually),till the very end(yet it is very blurry cause everything's happening too damn fast & without any clear explanation).Conclusion:2.5 hours of -no need- tension,on a very complex script which barely a 30% of viewers understood.This is NOT the Nolan we loved...
3/10."
" A more than one time watch movie
",remooheshmat,7,20 November 2021,"As usual, Nolan is obsessed with the concept of time, its physics' theories and scientific dreaming about travelling across time.The movie introduction scene is perfect, full of action and mystery, the travelling scene also is a powerfully directed scene, full of science fiction events, this scene is confusing and need to be watched again and again to understand what Nolan need to explain.Generally, it is one of the best movies I've seen for Nolan."
" Not really dude
",iluvfilm5,4,19 November 2021,"Imagine that you are in a hall, and someone is giving a speech by a dead language, for 2 hours and a half. Sure I can conceive your level of provocation. But what if after translating what he was saying, you discovered that he was speaking gibberish? Now, I can't conceive your level of anger!I couldn't understand a thing from this movie. While it's 150 minutes long, I have at least 150 unanswered questions. Every second is unbearable, with rare kind of bore; the bore of watching a running corpse that speaks cryptically and acts absurdly. And I didn't enjoy anything which could seduce me to watch the whole thing again. So as a movie that has leverage, through story or visuals, it doesn't!You read things like how director Christopher Nolan took more than 5 years to write the script. Ok, a right info, or a false publicity, both ways, this is so hasty script that didn't care whatsoever of building anything.As for the story, forget it, because the movie itself forgot it earlier. There is a wife who wants a divorce from an abusing husband, some plutonium, gold bars, a time machine, and unseen guys from the future. Now this gibberish was being said to you by a dead language, since the plot is tremendously arduous like a complicated maze, rather unsolvable enigma. The dialogue savored not telling you one thing clearly; even the pace of uttering it was robotic. And the editing is a villain, forcing me to believe that a computer did it all. Hence, the ugly result was robots that talk and walk, made by robot that writes and directs.It doesn't have the slightest dose of drama, overstepping abstraction to emptiness, transforming the essential into non-existent, and producing tons of confusion and repulsion. Can anybody tell me what's the lead's motive, history, or profession? What he was doing in the opera, or in the airport? And how does he survive death every time? Moreover, who is Neil? How the inverted weapons can destroy the world? What's the future guys' agenda? Just think: the heroine kisses her son, so we know that she loves him, but why not writing a situation to feel that?! The answer of this, and else, is laziness. The same laziness that made the movie's protagonist named simply ""the protagonist""!To save you more pains, let's jump to the climactic sequence: The shootout is a farce. I challenge you to comprehend who was doing what, or who came from the future to save who, and how he did it. The evil man suddenly monologues to the protagonist by a fabricated phone call. Generally, the movie has one of the biggest loads of fabrication I have ever seen. The editing is faster than your attention, and every attempt to understand a thing always ends unsuccessfully. Then a final scene that talks to itself, since the movie lost you already, and still insists on gibberish!Nolan seems haunted by James Bond movies badly. He thinks that changing the scenery, from nation to another, and stuffing the time with action sequences, yet without real plot or logic--can make an enjoyable movie anyway. But you know what? In Bond movies, we have more solid characters, even if paper thin, more comprehensible events, more dazzling action, and - most importantly - no annoying timeline!Speaking of which, the movie is highly annoying for the mind. The matter of moving normally in an inverted world is awfully fatiguing for the viewer, especially with the stingiest expositions, a cold-blooded killer of a dialogue, and that villainous editing!The reviewers say strange stuff. Some said it's about technology in our lives. So how is that exactly? Is it because the leads use cell phones for instance?! Accordingly, every contemporary movie and TV show is about technology! Some say that this movie is a masterpiece. When a movie is understood only by its maker, then is it a masterpiece or self indulgence?! Long story short, these reviewers don't want to look stupid, so they blabber about anything serious, even if it was imaginary.Btw, some reviewers say that the performance of John David Washington is good. What performance then? There weren't characters to be played in the first place. In this case, how come that any actor got the chance to show acting muscles, since there wasn't a body for him?! So when Washington was saying: ""I'm the protagonist of this operation!"" it was the top of naivety and patheticness. For me, his face was mute just like the movie's drama; so if he's praised for that, I totally agree!Virtues: I liked the first conversation between the protagonist and the evil guy. The mere thought of making a thriller through an inverted world. And that's about it.So what's (Tenet) in conclusion? I can't say it is a video game. Video games have more heat and fun. Their target is about giving you entertainment, not headache. And mostly they aren't full of pedantry and recklessness. Honestly, (Tenet) is a heartless, mindless, senseless, and joyless movie. Was it Nolan's hastiness, or ego? At any rate, the aftermath is a stupid movie that thinks itself intelligent, and if you asked me, this is the worst kind at all.It's not ""style over narrative"" as much as ""style runs over narrative"", and the scary part is that it became a tenet in Hollywood lately.P. S: How dare you reference (Casablanca)? It was a great movie, back when things like story and humanity were alive!"
" Great acting, poor script
",monatem,6,15 November 2021,"The cast, especially Washington, Branagh, Debicki, and Pattinson are very good. The action sequences are compelling.But none of this makes up for the poorly written script. For a science fiction film or book to be believable, it must extend the known laws of nature in ways that are credible. The further one gets into the movie, the sillier the basic concept seems."
" I am going to watch it again
",jessegehrig,10,15 November 2021,"I only had to get halfway through the movie before I knew I was going to watch it again. After the second viewing I knew I was going to go out into the world and buy a physical copy of the movie, DVD and bought at Vintage Stock, who should send me a check or store credit for the free advertising. After watching Tenet for the second time on the DVD I bought I regretted that I couldn't buy the movie again and I would have bought it again but I don't need two copies. IMDb recommends when writing a review to not make the review personal, I want you to interpret that to mean make it personal. I saw this movie and felt awesome to watch it."
" Another Overrated Mess by Christopher Nolan
",claudio_carvalho,5,14 November 2021,"""Tenet"" is another overrated mess by Christopher Nolan, who is a Hollywood's darling. The story seems to be written under influence, in a confused screenplay. The action and mainly the special effects are top notch. But Denzel Wahington's son is not adequate for the role of super-spy and the plot is a complete mess hard to be followed. ""Tenet"" is adequate for Nolan's worshipers that do not have prejudice to paradoxes and confused stories, and for pseudo-intellectuals that do not fully understand the plot and are ashamed to confess. Do not waste your time watching this long mess if you are not in the previous categories. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Tenet"""
" the best Nolan movie so far
",dragokin,6,14 November 2021,"This is the best movie made by Christopher Nolan so far. In fact, he borrowed from his whole cinematography and delivered his take at James Bond.What did he borrow? Non-linear storytelling (Memento), saving the world (Interstellar), introductory scenes similar to one of the Batman movies (I forgot which) etc. And in the first part of the movie we've been told more about the topic in a similar manner as in Inception.But naming what he took from where is not the point. Tenet is a good thriller, albeit with a bit of a formulaic plotline. However, it does offer some things you haven't seen on screen before, above all the last battle of the movie. When you get there, you'll know what I mean.The non-linear storytelling might be challenging, yet I disagree with those who claim you should watch Tenet several times before you understand what is going on. I also don't believe the understanding of the plot should be used as an IQ test.What I do believe is that Christopher Nolan did his best to offer a fine cinematic experience. But there is no deeper meaning behind it. Reading in such ideas is reserved for those who seem to know more about Tenet than the author himself."
" play the movie backwards
",peterbrady-14782,5,14 November 2021,"I was half expecting at the end credits, the movie would play again in reverse, where it all makes sense..It is very bond (Moore) like, which was enjoyable."
" Very Confusing Movie
",mochteam,6,13 November 2021,"I found it hard to understand the details of the plot and what exactly was going on a majority of the time. The movie just wasn't well explained.... I like the beginning where the scientist says ""just go with it"" when she tries to explain how the time thing works. That's how it felt... they just wanted you to ""go with it"" because little to nothing made sense. Redeeming factor of the movie Elizabeth Debicki was nice eye candy."
" Good addition to the Nolan catalogue but with a few major flaws
",melwinbauer,8,12 November 2021,"Tenet is essentially a spy, time-travel and save-the-world type movie. Made by Christopher Nolan with the cast consisting of the likes of John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Kenneth Branagh and Elizabeth Debicki and in lead roles, Tenet is a movie from the Bond mould that centers around the concept of time. A protaganist fights to save the world and in order to do so he must understand and traverse time in previously unthinkable ways.Tenet is a very confusing movie. As previously stated it plays around heavily with the very concept time itself. Tenet is most definitely better on a second watch as the concepts that Nolan introduces in the movie are hard to understand and grasp. After I first watched the movie on release I was absolutely dumbfounded. After a second watch I admit that it still was kind of confusing. Tenet doesn't do a very good job of explaining the concepts and barely tries. Instead Nolan shows it in action. Confusing can sometimes be bad but in this case I found the ambiguity of the movie intriguing and fascinating.I was absolutely able to enjoy the movie. It has great action sequences filled with intense car chases and hard-hitting fight scenes. The movie boasts a very impressive score that really sets the tone and fits the feeling of the movie.The one big negative I find about this movie is its main character played by Washington. I found Washington's acting mediocre and the character he plays bland and forgettable. We barely get to know him and he seems quite superficial and shallow when it comes to his character. Other than that, with a few exceptions, I don't like movies centered around saving the world. I think its overdone, boring and it takes me out of the immersion.To summarize, Tenet is good movie that is worth a watch but with a few major flaws that prevents it from reaching the upper echelon of modern cinema, a place which so many of Nolan's previous movies has been able to reach."
" Crazy, confusing and incomprehensible...
",vinifernandes,7,12 November 2021,"Crazy, confusing and incomprehensible...I LOVE ITWhat a different and empirical interpretation of the time, and technological advancements of the that could impact the past.It hard to understand and retain every single detail on the movie, however, it is beautiful and brilliantly structured."
" Force yourself to watch it twice
",rabiakh,9,12 November 2021,"So the first time I watched it, I thought it was okay. Entertaining enough, but confusing and I had no idea what was going on during the final segment.I had to look up various explanations, and videos which went further in-depth to explore the film's mechanics.Then I watched it a second time. The film niggled in my brain, forcing me to explain it and fully understand it. Only after all this and going back and watching it again did it finally make sense to me.And a film which is good enough to make me watch it twice and spend the next week thinking about it, is a very good film indeed.As far as the actual film goes, the acting is good, the actions scenes are spectacular, and I think it definitely has themes and meaning which extend beyond surface level. Definitely worth watching, especially if you enjoy sci-fi, action, and Chris Nolan."
" Great entertainment and concept but perhaps a bit too complicated
",mickman91-1,9,12 November 2021,"It was great to see this in cinema in the summer of 2020 when cinemas reopened for the first time since the start of Covid. Kudos to Mr Nolan for being the first to take the risk and support the cinema industry in this way. It was great entertainment and a very well made film that you can't help but have fun watching. One does wonder though if he makes it overly complex for the sake of showing off as it gets rather difficult to wrap your head around. Maybe this is done for the fans so they can watch over and over again picking up little nuggets of information with which to make more sense of the intricacies of the time travelling plot lines. Im not sure though. I do like that ultimately it is a cautionary tale to humanity about the perils of continuing to unconsciously destroy the planet. This was buried within the film you can even miss it if you miss just a few lines. I think this is wise because no one likes preachy films, yet it is there and integral to the plot. So it is very relevant as well as great filmmaking."
" Great movie!
",bernicecol,10,11 November 2021,Haven't had a movie that required brain work for a long time. Nolan managed to tie everything so well and very well made.Not recommended for people who just wants to shut off and veg out.
" The future wants us dead !
",mitrapourmand,10,11 November 2021,"Maybe not Nolan's best movie but definitely the best movie of its genre, when faced with a ruined planet the future generations decide to kill their grandparents, us ! They will blame us for everything so the will find a way to dance around the grandfather paradox, you know if you go back in time to kill your grandmother will yo be born to kill your grandfather, they want us dead cause every generation needs to look out for his own and we have /will blow their chances of normal future, but in doing so they will most probably end themselves thus bringing and end to the world so some of them are given information or are somehow recruited to prevent this plan. Tenet is a good example of pure desperation everyone is desperately trying to remain alive to continue living on a small scale it could be a wife trapped in a marriage to an arm dealer on larger scale it could be a whole generation, we do everything we can to have more time we might even try to reverse the time but in the end what's done is done. I really liked this movie I liked everything about the acting was solid the soundtrack was spot on and the direction was a real masterpiece. Don't miss this one ."
" A big headache
",stefanozucchelli,6,11 November 2021,"In this movie Nolan has completely lost control.The story itself is clear enough, there is a good, a bad, an imprisoned woman and a world to save. In short, nothing special or difficult to understand.What makes this film difficult to understand is the very confusing and too fast editing of the scenes.In the first ten minutes, the protagonist (whose name, due to a really exaggerated flicker of fantasy, is ''the protagonist "") is literally catapulted from one continent to another without the audience being able to follow what is happening.To worsen the understanding of the film is the inverse time. A technology coming from the future so futuristic that the director never understood how exactly it works. In different situations there is a character who clearly tells the protagonist that he must not try to understand what is happening because otherwise he would have a headache and in any case he would not have understood. The first time the scientist tells him and the second time a comrade in arms."
" Awesome confusing action
",yaszi-83296,8,10 November 2021,"The movie has a cool bu weird concept, it is a Chris Nolan film so it was pretty good, it had a lot of weird but awesome action, the characters are all great, the movie looks astonishing, their is a lot of time travel as well so some of the scenes look extra crazy with thing going forward & back in time. I think you should just lay back and enjoy the action, it is a quite catastrophic, long and strange film.The movie is overall pretty confusing but good, the music is loud and a lot of bass, but it fits, most of Nolan's films have intense crazy music that mostly fit the scenes in the movies great. The acting is also good, it's not only the protagonist that is good, but all the main characters were awesome in my opinion!"
" Not what I expected
",catherinemansillah,3,9 November 2021,"It was boring, long, so hard to understand...I found it to lack emotion and heart. It was just a mess. I didn't even try to understand it, just enjoy it but that wasn't possible either.Nothing like the previous work of C. Nolan..."
" Tenet was dull
",WhistlingNostril,1,8 November 2021,"Looked forward to seeing this so much,the opening scene was promising (hence the 1 star) then downhill from there.John David Washington was miscast (hollywood nepotism..again!) Robert Pattinson should've been the lead (he could at least emote)
Kenneth Brannah overacting with ludicrous accent and the female character was memorable only because she literally stood out (towered over every male character)This is the kind of film that makes industry insiders nod heads & agree its phenomenal filmmaking while us plebs are like ""wtaf are you doing Nolan?""Mumbled lines under heavy background sound,with a lead actor who needs a ladder to make eye contact with leading lady...Such a disappointment..On the plus side,could possibly help insomnia."
" Something different
",RaphaelNeo,8,8 November 2021,"This is a film that will punish you for not being completely invested into it, you have to pay attention and keep up with the fast moving narrative and the sometimes confusing dialouge between each character. There is absolutely no room to breathe in this film and each scene has some kind of significance to the story. This is again, a film where you have to view it more than once, which can be offputting and might not be for everyone, aswell as the characters which seem to come out of nowhere and don't really have that much development."
" Another Masterpiece
",pauls-25727,10,6 November 2021,"This is another masterpiece from the legend Mr Nolan. I've enjoyed all his movies apart from Dunkirk for some reason, maybe I expected too much from it or that it was a bland story with brave civilians based on a true story.From the opening I knew I'd really enjoy this after watching the trailers a few times and reading up on it. I loved the time travel aspect keeping entropy stable and how it all worked. I watched it twice back to back just like I do with all his other movies apart from yes Dunkirk.Some people hate the protagonist but I found him enjoyable to watch and a decent end job acting in this. The other actors stood out on their own merits especially Branaghs character, played perfectly.Will I watch this again....definitely just like I do with 2 others of Mr Nolan's movies being Inception and my favourite movie ( top 3 ) Interstellar ( I love space themed movies not matter what they are about I'll give them a try ).Overall I gave it 10/10 because for me it was perfect with just a few flaws. Highly enjoyable experience."
" Stunning visual effects.
",syarwanhamid,7,5 November 2021,"No doubt, this visual effect really mesmerizing. Forward and backward, future and the past is really easy recognizable. But the story is to heavy for audience, one hours I almost feel asleep."
" great visuals, but confusing
",iamBakasur,7,5 November 2021,"Even at the end was not satisfied, didn't understood it in one watch.Had to go through reddit/youtube theories etc to get the actual feel of movie.Visuals were great, but unlike other nolan movies this was bit more confusing, also character development was very low."
" Memento will always be one of my favourite mind bending movies....
",ukproject,3,5 November 2021,"...despite the constant stream of convoluted tripe that Christopher Nolan keeps pumping out.As someone who loves trying to piece clues together, with Tenet I simply couldn't be bothered to even try. There is nothing to figure out here as Tenet is just one long gimmick.I've now come to expect being disappointed by the latest Christopher Nolan movie that everyone seems to be raving about, and in that sense Tenet exceeded my expectations.A complete and utter load of tripe."
" A better spy thriller than most Bond movies
",BoshArrow,8,4 November 2021,"Confusing and complex plot, lots of exposition, people nervously trying to find any reason for what is going on: yes, the movie has many issues and it is far behind other Nolan's masterpieces such as The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, Memento or The Prestige but it is still an engaging spy thriller.Christopher Nolan manages to greatly recreate the intense spy atmosphere from the best Bond and Bourne movies and delivers really entertaining action sequences. Washington and Pattinson form a successful partnership which is the key element throughout the entire plot, while Branagh stars as the formidable and influential Sator. His character is certainly better developed than Rami Malek's Safin in No Time to Die.Tenet is a visually stunning movie since most of the locations are quite well picked with scenes in India, Vietnam, Estonia, Great Britain and Ukraine. In addition, the visual effects are significant and essential aspect of the film and their execution is outstanding.To sum up, you will probably need to watch Tenet more than once in order to fully appreciate it. It definitely has more positive than negative sides which makes it a good movie! Don't rush into conclusions and be patient while watching it!"
" A Disastrous Masterpiece
",jithinr-83154,2,3 November 2021,"This movie tried to became a ""masterpiece"" , but it failed terribly, in its own logic and plot holes. I felt like Christopher had gone too far trying to fool people with using some jargon ""physics"" paradoxes , which doesn't even make sense to people who understands ""physics"". It was that bad. The fast pase dramatic scenes, mumbled dialogues, and confusing characters with confusing timelines of the movie, made it almost unwatchable! Sorry Nolan, it was a ""Disastrous Masterpiece"""
" Disjointed
",mycannonball,3,2 November 2021,"A movie should work as a movie, not just as a conversation piece where you dissect the ways in which it was disjointed and nonsensical. Not good storytelling. Sometimes I feel like ""big"" directors get worse as their career progresses. Is that because they're surrounded by Yes People who can't give them critical feedback that's badly needed?"
" Just tenet
",mmm-90238,10,1 November 2021,"I think this is the beginning of beautiful movie.This movie definitely has the best balance between explanation and self-interpretation.

" Need to Know and You Don't
",compugor,8,31 October 2021,"An enjoyable watch if one can accept that this is not a documentary that should be relegated to one's logical sensibilitues on a technical level; its a sci-fi spy thriller. Denzel's son does a good job as a scrappy & smart ""protagonist"" with a unique screen presence compared to the archtypical ""tall, dark & handsome"" hero. Even as long as it is , the audience gets no more understanding of the ""reverse entropy"" technology than the film's characters do, who got it from their future. The establishment of ""policies"" to avoid potential temporal (existential) catastrophe and/or mind-blowing paradoxes, was the best they could do as they developed experience with it. That right there is an underappreciated director's technique of the characters in the film asking the same questions that the audience is asking at the same time. Perhaps not enough need to know is satisfied as the convolution thickens, but the extraordinary special effects make it so that you really don't need to know."
" Acting was great
",kumaraanjana,10,31 October 2021,"There's so much to digest with this movie. Time moving forwards and backwards at the same time is mind blowing. The plot is chaotic, admittedly I only had a vague notion of what was going on throughout the film. The time changes are beautifully synchronized and flow seamlessly. The cinematography is beautiful. Acting was great from the whole cast."
" So much wrong in the first five minutes
",stehan-14703,5,30 October 2021,"As a musician, I simply can't get over all the things wrong in the first five minutes of this movie. The biggest mistake is the two sousaphones you see on stage. A real orchestra would have real tubas, not sousaphones! What a joke. Then there is the tuning up sounds. Even if you give Mr. Noland some license to make that sound more eerie than in real life, it still sounded unrealistic to me. They when you see how the orchestra is seated on stage, the best I can say it is not how you would normally set up an orchestra on a stage. Seems like they had no one on set who knew anything about making the start of the movie look and sound real. For me, I could not get this out of my head and it ruined the rest of the movie for me. Kind of like a blind date with too much makeup. Just can't get past that first impression. Sorry to say."
" TOO SUPERFICIAL!
",theblessedtroll,5,29 October 2021,"I believe, if Nolan watched this movie for the first time, as an outsider like all the plain audience, he will not understand the plot enough to enjoy the film as a whole. Obviously, he took years to set all the pieces. And from this normal confusion state, the film becomes with so few attractive things to feel about it...and very superficial in form."
" Watch with subtitles or else ð«ð«ð«
",David78915,9,29 October 2021,"I'll keep this brief and state my opinion on all the times ive watched TENET.1st watch - boring, slow, wtf is going on, why do people be walking backwards2nd watch - incredible...incredible...incredible - must watch - i understood the complex story3rd watch - same as 2nd with a few more incredible's. In my opinion it rivals Interstellar and Inception - MY OPINION.In conclusion, watch with subtitles several times as it gets better every watch.In my 2nd conclusion if you really like TENET watch DARK. Please!!"
" Unwatchable Garbage
",michaeljameshill-98919,4,28 October 2021,"Nolan went out of his way here to be the ""I'm smarter than the audience"" director and the movie suffered greatly as a result. The rules of the movie's main gimmick don't make any sense and aren't applied consistently, the characters are forgettable, flat, and undeveloped, the score is way too loud and key dialogue can't be heard as a result. In the end there's really nothing to like about this film. The plot is next to impossible to follow by design, there is nothing to like about the characters, and the movie's main gimmick gets old fast. All I can say is that this movie was so terrible it felt like it was 4 hours long and at the end of it my wife and myself were like, ""What the eff did we just watch?"". Complete trash."
" Unique sci-fi, for multiple rewatches
",DJShittyMusic,8,26 October 2021,"I think unique twisted sci-fi is where Nolan shines best, and if you have been a fan since Memento, I think you would enjoy this film as well. The pacing is quite fast, and the audio (voicelines) are sometimes hard to hear so it's best to watch in a home theater. These types of movies get better with every rewatch, pulling you deeper into the philosophical rabbit hole that the movie centers its concepts on. I can understand why opinions are so divided on this film though. For viewers that enjoy the more straightforward plots to watch in one sitting (Batman triology, Interstellar, etc.), this title is probably not for them."
" Incosequent, derivative, stupid and boring
",piotereks,1,23 October 2021,I am huge fan of visionary sci-fi and even complex constructs.Here inconsequent scenario destroys any attemps to understand the actions.Inconsequences are because of non determinictic interactions beween this thread actors and other thread objects.Why you assume everything need to be inverted? Nonsence.
" Do you see the narcissism of this movie?
",BerkayKuscu,5,23 October 2021,"Nolan is a genius without a doubt and he proves it again and again with all his movies. However, I perceived this movie as a step further in the sense that he does not want to prove himself but rather expect us to respect and give more appreciation to his genius.How many times did you feel lost during the movie? How many times you were searching for an answer to what has just happened? How many times did you have to watch to understand the whole plot? Inception was a very complicated masterpiece but it was understandable. Interstellar was crazy but based on an understandable and meaningful plot. This movie is directed on purpose to be overcomplicated and obscure. This movie wants to be rewatched again and again until you get all the answers from really small details.Throughout the movie, I felt like Nolan was testing my intelligence and wishing me to fail by giving explanations that does not make sense until the very end of the movie. I felt like he wanted me to get lost and just appreciate that he is the creator of this complex paradoxical narrative.I don't like it. I don't want to be belittled by a movie and I will definitely not spend my time to understand his genius. This movie has serious problems in terms of communicating with the audience."
" A brilliantly crafted espionage time-traveling film!
",partypishposh,10,23 October 2021,"Wow! Just WOW! Tenet is the best espionage, sci-fi film that I have watched throughout the past years. The cast all act in a way that their director, Christopher Nolan, would have wanted. Sure, the plot could be complex but that doesn't take away the entertainment that this beautifully crafted film gave us. Tenet is trying to give the audience something new, and I sincerely adore that, BUT some people might not agree with the experimentation that Christopher Nolan is trying to do. But like I said, it's still entertaining, no matter how complex the plot is and how dull and boring the Protagonist (John David Washington) acts, it still is a movie that is nonetheless, an entertaining espionage.THE MIND-BLOWING COMPLEX PLOT - (10/10)
The plot in Tenet is something that is incredibly unique and different from other sci-fi espionage. From inverted bullets to running up buildings, no one can deny that the plot and idea Nolan has gave us is far more complex than Interstellar (2014) and Inception (2010). But some people might not like the confusion that Nolan's latest movie, Tenet, has brought to the audience which is completely understandable to those who adore Tenet in a way which confusion is an advantage. I absolutely love Tenet's complex plot, no matter how confusing and mind-bending it could be. To conclude my thoughts on Tenet's plot, I'd say that it is complex, confusing & different, but in a good way which could lead people into a different entertainment experience, understandable plot (if watched more than 1 time) but most importantly, it could lead people's mind into thinking that this movie, that's hated by a lot of people and critics, is a masterpiece.CAST - (8/10)
John David Washington was brilliant but a little dull on the main part of acting, facial expressions. I see what Nolan was trying to do here, by casting JDW. He's trying to make JDW be known by the people and to help him succeed in an acting career just like how his father did (Denzel Washington). Unfortunately, due to the bad reviews by critics and fans, John David Washington is considered a lazy casting.But Edward Cullen (A. K. A. Robert Pattinson) was far more likable and far more exceptional than the Protagonist himself. Robert Pattinson was dashing and his role for Neil, was an acting phenomenon. From the introduction of Neil towards the end of a beautiful friendship, his dialogue and physical acting was done brilliantly.Elizabeth Debicki was also a good casting and a good actress. She is the cream on the cake in Christopher Nolan's TENET. You could see the depression and despair in Debicki's eyes when ever she encounters Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh) and if you could notice, you know it's a good performance.Speaking of Kenneth Branagh, he's a one-of-a-kind villain in Tenet. He is your typical British boomer that was tasked to give a thick Russian accent and I was convinced that he was an actual Russian boomer. You could see in Kenneth's acting that he was made for the role of Andrei Sator. From his eyes to legs, his entire body was acting for a role that was deeply cruel. Since Debicki and Branagh are an estranged couple in Tenet, the connection between them was brilliant. Branagh's cold & abusive behavior and Debicki's sad, miserable acting was a perfectly brewed chemical in Nolan's work.PRODUCTION AND VISUAL EFFECTS - (10/10)
Personally for me, the production that was being done to create this one-of-a-kind film was exquisite. The filming process and cinematography was all just perfect for me. And Hoyte van Voytema was EXCEPTIONAL! His work on Tenet was beautiful, from landscapes of Oslo to Tallinn was absolutely gorgeous. The iMAX camera brought a huge and expensive experience in which audiences can connect with the film in such a beautiful & amazing setting.The visual effects were something else in Tenet! The building explosion during the 'Stalsk-12 War' and the plane crash in Oslo brilliantly made and was amazing! And the cinematic shots in Tenet were practical and undeniably impressive. Thanks to the VFX artists Andrew Jackson, David Lee, Andrew Lockley and Scott Fisher, their visual work on Tenet won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.SOUNDTRACK - (10/10)
One word to describe the soundtrack in Tenet, PERFECT. It really suits with the experience of a complex film. My favorite piece from Oscar winner Ludwig GÃ¶ransson was the Freeport scene in Tenet, that just blew my ears and made my experience when watching Tenet even better!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION:
Tenet is an underrated, mind-bending, time-traveling, epic sci-fi MASTERPIECE that needs a second viewing (or more) to fully understand and compliment the complex plot and acting. I sincerely believe that this movie is one of Nolan's finest wine."
" Difficult to understand
",maatougfares,1,22 October 2021,"I don't know why directors sometimes suppose that we like to repeat a movie five times to get it , i personnally don't like that and as a result i don't like this movie
Besides spectacular action scenes this movie is an assembly of chaotic events
If u like Solving movies like math problems go ahead."
" Was so excited to watch... not great.
",jayroyle2,3,21 October 2021,"As Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors, seeing the trailer for this film rly made me excited to watch.Before I carry on, I must say the cinematography in the film is genuinely stunning, however the same can't be said about the plot and overall film. Having watched inception and marked it as one of the greatest of all time. I am sure I can understand and appreciate an intricate plot line. However watching this I found myself puzzled throughout.I really wanted to enjoy the film but genuinely didn't understand it. I think Nolan went over the top on this one. Maybe I'll try and watch again soon."
" Most Confusing Movie in the world
",emnotic,1,21 October 2021,"The Director of this movie sucks. If a better director made this movie, it would have been less confusing and just simply done better. This movie is lame and it's not worth watching it twice because it's just simply not worth it. I can't understand why other reviewers gave this movie a high rating because this movie really sucked. That just goes to show you, you can't judge a movie just by high reviews. I thought it was going to be good because it got high review score. BOY WAS I WRONG TO THINK THIS WAS GOING TO BE A GOOD MOVIE, LOL...anyways I'll let you decide on what you think about this movie. Watch it and let me know. I really would like to see the ratings score go down because by keeping it high it's giving watchers false hope that this is actually going to be a good movie when in fact it's just really confusing and pretty lame."
" What did I just watch
",gfwvmcka,5,20 October 2021,"I'd really love to know what this was all about and what Christopher Nolan was trying to achieve, but all he ended up with is 2 and a half hours of pure complicated drivel.The action scenes are good (as usual with CN movies), but the storyline to so twisted and complex, that I bet even he doesn't know what's going on.I'd say when writing the screenplay, he forgot to number the pages and at some stage, a big gust of wind blew them all over the place and he just randomly put them all back together.People who rate this movie ten do so to make themselves look good, as there is absolutely no way that anyone could give such a high score and fully understand it.If you have multiple masters and PhDs and you understand the phyiscs of time travel, then give this movie a miss, as I guarantee even you won't get it."
" Met my expectations.
",wadeswaxmuseum,10,19 October 2021,"1ST, I'd like to say, Patterson finally,for me,was enjoyable to watch. I thought he did a fine job( unlike many reviewers). I made it through the movie just fine. It wasn't exceptionally heady but definetaly worthy of a 2ND viewing....as was Inception..to go back and appreciate the concept and portrayal of the plot. Nolan blows me away...he is a visionary....an imagination specialist. Minor nitpicking aside Tenet is light years ahead of most films today..a film that you must invest yourself in."
" Brilliant
",rafiado,8,19 October 2021,"What a brilliant idea, this movie was super cool with a super awesome Cinematography, acting, plot, and the reverse things, the reverse was super cool and surprising me. How did Christopher Nolan have a lot of brilliant idea for his movie.There's a plot twist in the middle of the movie that everything, not everything but his mission what he do from the past that have reverse thing, the reverse was him, I don't know how to explain but this movie was super cool and super amazing, super amaze me. I really love the plot twist it's not plot twist but maybe It's kinda plot twist that the reverse from his past mission was him, from the middle of the movie until the movie end I was really really amaze with it, how Christopher Nolan can thing about this.I recommend you to watch this movie cause this movie was super cool."
" I Can't Recommend Seeing This Movie!
",dr_john_pollard,2,19 October 2021,"I just watched it. I found the acting tolerable, it was interesting to see how far the insanity of the plot and story were going to stretch. Just about none of it was even slightly believable, but I guess that's what Nolan is famous for, so be it. It couldn't even be classified as sci-fi; it's just stupid. Filming Vietnam as mountain cliffs is just one example. One man's opinion."
" A bit disappointing but worth the watch
",lidguy,7,18 October 2021,"Tenet is visually stunning, and the time inversion scenes are incredibly well done. Beyond that, the film ranges from decent to borderline bad. It's confusing and difficult to follow, but not in the way you'd expect. The time inversion stuff is pretty straight forward. It might have you scratching your head for a minute here and there, but if you can, as one character says, ""stop thinking linearly,"" it becomes clear. What's confusing is the overarching plot outside of this. Half the time I couldn't make out what the characters were saying, and the other half they were speaking in riddles. After reading the synopsis afterward and going back to key scenes with subtitles on, I gained a little more respect for the plot, though it still has its problems. The big, central threat falls apart if you think about it too much, and there are a couple deus ex machinas that seem incredibly unnecessary for a film that can just blame everything on time travel (sorry, inversion). Clunky dialogue and pacing issues don't do it any favors either. If this is your first go around, please turn the subtitles on - watching this in a theater would have been a rough time.My other big gripe is that, aside from the sci-fi concepts and visuals, Tenet is missing all of the other aspects one would expect from a movie like this, especially one done by Christopher Nolan. There are no moral qualms or ethical questions that characters must face, and the characters themselves are almost entirely devoid of emotion or personal motivation. This is true of the unnamed, Bond-esque protagonist, whose get-the-job-done-with-a-conscience character type is firmly established in the opening minutes. For the protagonist, this kind of character works, and John David Washington does a fantastic job of it. But if the hero won't carry the emotional weight, that job needs to fall to someone else. Most would choose the antagonist, Branagh, but his character is even more one-note and often feels like a caricature of a villain. Instead Nolan chooses the antagonist's wife, played by Debicki, who at best feels unnecessary and at worst is a burden to the plot. As the emotional core she falls incredibly flat. Pattison was surprisingly good in his role, though his character is pretty much a British version of Washington's.Tenet is a cool movie with some fantastic action to it, and taken alone it's a good-but-not-great type of film. But Nolan, whether you're a fan or not, has established himself as a higher caliber filmmaker than this movie would suggest, and compared to his other films I'd say it's pretty bad. Inception is a good comparison; it tackles an equally out-there sci-fi concept which it also uses to its advantage in crafting stunning visual sequences. But Inception keeps it going from there, giving multiple characters motivations, emotions, and philosophical dilemmas to face. Tenet seems to forget that, while these concepts might not be the biggest draw, they are just as important in crafting a quality story."

",khutton-47311,1,17 October 2021,"I have absolutely no idea what I just watched and the more I think about it, the less I know.

" Too complex to follow and fully understand but amazing

" Not as good as it thinks it is
",Leofwine_draca,7,9 October 2021,"Christopher Nolan's latest head-scratching thriller is a far cry from INCEPTION, although as a blockbuster action film in the Bond mould it's fairly enjoyable. But, like DUNKIRK, it manages to be seriously flawed too, and less good than it thinks it is. It suffers hugely from a lead actor who can't actually act; even the Indian kid from EASTENDERS would have been better. Robert Pattinson, Kenneth Branagh and Michael Caine all act Washington off the screen at various points. As for the time travel, it's more like time reversal, and is essentially a MacGuffin which allows the director to incorporate some cool trickery into the otherwise routine action bits. Not bad, but not a film I'll think much about in years to come."

" Limitations to the Willing suspension of disbelief
",fmt-96-787608,3,2 October 2021,"Like King Midas in Greek mythology, Christopher Nolan has earned a reputation for turning everything he touches into gold, even when he tackles those convoluted subjects he's so fond of (Inception, Interstellar). Unfortunately even geniuses can sometimes go into pieces... Tenet is made up to divide. I, for certain, assume a clear-cut judgment: this film is abstruse, sterile, pretentious. Alas, a complete wreck.Nolan like a dream factory. And the dream factory gives birth to a two and a half hour blockbuster... that falls apart within the first hour. Cruel. On reflection, it is perhaps due to its long gestation (20 years) that might explain the failure of the film. Immersed in his research on the inversion of entropy (don't ask me to explain what it means), the filmmaker ended up losing sight of the fact that a film is no PhD in physics.Tenet is not a failure because its story is complex. It is a failure because the filmmaker does not want us to understand it - if that was possible. Due to a lack of basic information and knowledges, we are not capable of investing ourselves because nothing encourages us to do so: neither the characters, nor the interpretation (excepting the brilliant Robert Pattinson), nor even the so confusing action. Let's concede that the film is nervous, its aestetics is amazing, which allows us to stay awake during the two and a half hours of projection.If Tenet is the Nolan's James Bond, then, good Lord, in your infinite goodness, please don't let Christopher ever have access to this franchise. He would be able to play the famous Monty Norman theme backwards."

" Bad, bad, confusing
",larabrkovic,1,1 October 2021,Please dont waist your time to watch or understand this movie. This is the worst Nolan.
" Puzzling
",operacha-39498,1,1 October 2021,"This movie is way too long. But it did give me ample time to puzzle over whether it was the atrocious writing that made the acting seem so bad or the wooden acting that made the writing so dull. Quite the conundrum. I find it hard to believe that Christopher Nolan birthed this BS. However, I am keeping the faith in Nolan by assuming that, as a lark, he got together a room full of 8 year old boys, had them ""write"" a movie, slapped together all their disparate thoughts and voila . . . We got ourselves an action movie."
" Very simple idea, extremely complicated plot for a reason.
",stibati,8,1 October 2021,"Movie becomes complicated for the very good reason which can be discovered after couple of rewatches and listening to some explanation online.Uncommon, supremely executed movie."

" Not impressed and very confusing
",StevePunchard,5,29 September 2021,"The best I can say about Tenet was the forward action hand to hand fighting scenes were quite good, John Washington is exceptional and the lead female was hot. Other than that the simultaneous mix of forward and reverse action scenes, for many characters, just didn't add up. Neither did how the world was going to blow up by a single bomb.Did we really need the regular briefings of fictional technical explanations, followed up by useless analogies, to attempt to explain what's to happen? They never did. Instead the scenes seemed to regularly evolve into something entirely different.At 2 and a half hours I got bored even when the action was pumping. As an example, watching a 2 minute fight scene in reverse, that we already saw forward, left me yawning. Wouldn't watch it again that's for sure.I hope someone actually reads and likes my review as there are 5,200+ other user reviews, with an average 7.4 rating, for Tenet (must be a record); maybe I just wrote it for a reminder to myself."
" Don't
",teooprescu,1,29 September 2021,Don't listen to the latest review. The movie sucks. The guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
" SF and fantasy readers out there..
",snouu,10,29 September 2021,"Think of great sf&fantasy movies. Now think of great romance or comedy movies. There quite a discrepancy between the amount of titles coming in your head answering these different questions. Now here comes Nolan, every movie movie of his bringing a new title on the top of the list of this genre.The true beauty of this genre that most people who aren't into it don't get is consisted of the layers on which the movie is built. There is the incredible story and then there are the ideas behind. Kat looks at her future self with admiration thinking that she wants to be free like her one day. Let that sink in...
What's happened's happened.. Imagine being already dead while talking to you future past best friend.There were three instances of the same people at the same moment in time in the same place...I get it. This movie doesn't appeal to all. It is about valuing different aspects of movies. The production of this movie is unbelievable, and it is also touching, it is just the different approach on feelings that puts people off. And the ""complexity"" of the idea.Imagine thinking, writing and creating this. Genius is not enough of a word for Cristopher Nolan."
" Not for casual viewing
",carinnalowther,7,28 September 2021,"If you watch this movie, you have to be paying attention. It makes perfect sense as long as you are actually engaged with the movie.This is not true of most blockbuster movies and I appreciated the change.I was surprised that they didn't reveal Neal as Max. Also intrigued about the future and potential sequel they left open."
" A time loop paradox - scifi written probably by a scientist
",spacekarma,7,28 September 2021,So I watched this movie only now and not in cinema after reading lots of bad reviews calling this movie stupid. I think it's not stupid it's actually pretty smart.The war that started this all actually captured everyone in this alternate earth into a time loop paradox where the time actually travels from A to B and then when it reaches it's end point it doesn't jump to beginning but actually flows backwards from B to A. So half of the movie happens forward while half of the movie is backwards and the watcher has to connect the points to make any sense.The Idea of the movie that is played in the same time in both directions is just pure genius.This idea must only come from a science mind because for us 3 dimensional beings this is very very confusing. But that the time is in a constant flux and cannot be changed is basically the whole meaning of this movie.They try to avoid something that already has happened will happen and would happen even if they didn't do anything.And they constantly try to avoid telling their other self to actually change something. The protagonist actually interacts few times with him self in the movie without realizing but has a mask so he doesn't compromise the timeline which in the end actually make this time loop happen in first place. There is few things they didn't want us to know and that is how this happened actually in future? How do they know before it happens?Only ridiculous thing I found was reverse air that you must take so you can move backward. I think they should have gone with a special suit that can reverse radiation or something more meaningful. And this little ridiculous thing and the anti climactic ending was why I gave this movie a 7. First 1 hour of the movie could be really mostly reduced and ending fixed. But the whole idea for the movie was ingenious.
" Believe the critics!
",zsolt-bogai-259-806739,3,27 September 2021,Either Mr. Nolan has underestimated his audience or his audience has overestimated him - this movie is NOT ENJOYABLE.Will you enjoy a movie that questions you IQ? With no facts that it could prove it's point with...
" Confused
",saniljubic,5,27 September 2021,I need to watch this at least 3 time to understand.... love Nolan but.....
" Do not read reviews with 6 or less...
",AngryChainsaw,8,27 September 2021,"This is certainly not a movie for the average American because he will need at least three views of the same as he want to understand what it is about; of course considering the fact that his IQ is above 95...
This is a masterpiece in a year (2020th.) that did not provide any blockbuster like this, even more, so this was a year of copied cheap horror movies, but the action fantastic, sci fi thriller, certainly deserves a rating of at least 7, even with those viewers who are looking for hair in the egg, so don't pay attention and don't read the reviews which they have a lower grade... Simply as, if you liked Interstellar, you will also like this movie, which certainly has more action and less sci fi moments, although the script of this movie so far is unique, as is the scenario. The acting is satisfactory, considering the choice of actors and the overall budget, the photography is excellent, the directing - standard good, and the computer processing of individual shots is magnificent, as well as the editin...
My warm recommendation ..."
" Robert Pattinson's Performance Prompted Me to Write Review
",j889,5,26 September 2021,"The dialog and the music are just awful. This film is terrible with out Hans Zimmer. The music director is terrible. Robert Pattinson is probably the only good thing coming out of this film. The film is awfully complex and confusing. The plot is somewhat tedious if you really think about it. It is a logic mess. Christopher Nolan utilize a simple concept (time travel again, and traveling backwards) into a needlessly, tried-to-be mind-blowing film (like Inception), which he failed. The film is about beautiful bro-love. Neil loves Protagonist, and ultimately he dies for him (or the mission, but you have got to love someone to die for him, right?).John David Washington's performance as the protagonist is just boring. He's emotionless. Christopher Nolan put John David Washington there just to ride on the BLM movement of Hollywood. You see more acting from Dimple Kapadia, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Robert Pattinson. Personally, Robert Pattinson's performance really shined, and it prompted me to check out his other films (minus Twilight). The protagonist is not the protagonist, in many ways, Pattinson is.If you have watched some of Christopher Noland's films, Tenet is quite easy to understand. Highly Over Rated.At least, the Chinawashing is subtle here."
" What the Hell...
",boofool,5,26 September 2021,"If I'm walking down the street and these inverted dudes are driving down the street in cool Audi's, backwards, do I see them? Or are they going backwards invisible like? I was confused as heck, but it was alot of action, I'll give it that..."
" Ouch, my head!
",NotMoreMovies,3,26 September 2021,"I know there are hard core Nolan fans out there, but most of his movies just hurt my head! This is one of them...what the (bleep) is this? It made no sense, start to finish. I did watch the whole thing, and at the at the end, I was just as confused as I was at the beginning.I only ever liked one of his movies...and that was Memento. The rest of his his movies just made my head hurt. I only watched Tenet because I got HBO free this week...there was a parody team who called the show NOLON, and I loved that...although I hate them (Cracked on YouTube) because they have more trolls working for them than living under all the bridges in the world (snicker).But I digress...I just don't get Nolan anymore, and this movie just spins it's wheels...it makes no sense, and anyone who likes it is just hoping to score some Nolan points :)"
" Made me feel dumb
",dariamar-86555,2,26 September 2021,"I love sci-fi movies but after watching 75% of this movie, I found myself writing this review. It's confusing as hell and I am not easily confused by complex movie plots. I didn't even care to see how it ended. I also agree with some of the other reviewers that I had a hard time hearing/understanding a lot of the dialogue. It had a promising story line, but the inversion was just too much to wrap my brain around."
" Complicated
",rohitlawange,7,25 September 2021,"The movie is great, but overly complicated. Inception feels like piece of cake in comparison to this movie."
" It is very interesting
",rrshnsq,8,22 September 2021,"In the movie ""Tenet"", time plays an even greater role. He is the main character of the film. However, this is not an ordinary time travel movie. Time in ""Tenet"" is not linear and may run in the opposite direction to ""normal"" - from later events to those earlier. This complicated issue is the axis of Nolan's new film and makes us not only shocked but also fascinated when we leave the screening."
" Love the storyline
",bmkhudson,6,22 September 2021,"Love the storyline but can't hear the dialogue because it's too loud. Watched the dvd, live rural with no wifi, and no matter what I do with the sound on the dvd player, tv volume or the sound box I could not hear anything but the background noise. At least with Dunkirk I could hear the dialogue."

" Knowing the plan

" o_O
",jalamorena,4,21 September 2021,"I have never ever been sooooo confused during and after a movie in my life. My cousins and I watched this movie as a private watch party. During the movie, I could not help myself but laugh and finally text in our group chat, ""does anyone know wtf is going on????"" Hahahaha we all left the movie hella lost and still joke about it til this day or joke about rewatching it."
" Amazing but not for everyone
",bilgenur-75983,10,20 September 2021,I loved TENET so much and it is not because I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan. This movie is clever by all means and expects you to be clever as well. This definetely is not your saturday movie night movie. However I believe that if you are going to rank this movie it except you to put some effort. If you love mind bending concepts GO FOR IT + great soundtrack.
" Audibly challenged
",frederickwj,5,20 September 2021,"Entertaining premise, brave casting (only a few of the leads can actually act) and audibly challenging, I'm still giving it 5 because it kicked off some rigorous and mind bending discussion in our house. Looking forward to Batman."
" Back to childhood
",RomBlixen,3,20 September 2021,"This movie looks as if it's got something awesome, but then it hasn't. FX are great but decontextualised within an unfollowable plot. You end up watching the pictures but unable to read the story, just as when you where a kid. How's that for retro?"
" Not lived up to it's hype!
",snkkylo,7,19 September 2021,"In nolan movies we expect something extraordinary!Tenet has some awe dropping scenes too, but story? Goodness story is same like some random hollywood BS. Where good guys always manages to make everything right in the end. ð¤£
Our good boy hero (who happens to be some high level officer) goes nuts over saving some blonde and gives WMD tool to bad guy,that blonde female just ruined this movie for me, her character was so useless and annoying that it made me question that this movie was really made by nolan?This movie has one of the most stupid loud BGM."
" As Christopher Nolan fan you need more IQ to understand of his classic things
",andreicatabay,9,19 September 2021,"I'm a Christopher Nolan fan for 10 years since I understand the Movie called inception and I'm confused when 1st watching and fully understand in2nd watching and in 4 years it's like that but in a space,but when 6 years it's kind of 1.5 or 2 times more confusingð but the things why I rate this 9 stars because the story was kind of good and I am a Christopher Nolan fan but why I do not rat this because it's very confusing,there's a story not like other movies like some of gorilla movies but the story is just confusingly."
" Just a little too silly and confused
",csm-78119,4,18 September 2021,A decent lead performance from John David Washington and the direction of Christopher Nolan can't save a film that tries to be clever but ends up being in large part pretentious nonsense and a little boring as a consequence. Such a shame. I'm sure Nolan will return to his normally excellent filmmaking standards on his next venture.
" Pointlessly confusing
",wiltd1,1,18 September 2021,"This is such a mess of a movie, it seems to have been produced around an idea of things traveling back in time, skipping how utterly ridiculous that concept is the story then runs on to build more and more pointless exposition and banal action, Nolan is lost, he would have been better to let this drop onto a streaming platform where it would have been forgotten immediately instead of demanding attention with this mess of a movie.Spectacularly wasted cast too."
" Unenjoyable bilge
",markcoyle,1,18 September 2021,"Terrible sound, awful plot, clichÃ©s everywhere, self-indulgent. No emotional connection at all. Time loop plot done far better and simpler in such as Arrival. Don't fall for the hype, this is just a bad film all round. Let's stop with these empty blockbusters, overly complex structures and tell some stories."
" Appreciate Nolan's Greatness
",zacharyrivas21,8,18 September 2021,"What a ride it was watching this film for the first time! But also what a thrill it was trying to grasp the multiple realities and timelines presented in 'Tenet'. Yes, it is confusing. Yes, you will need to watch countless YouTube videos explaining the plot. And yes, the only way to truly understand this film would be for Christopher Nolan himself to be sitting right beside you. But once you begin to comprehend, ever so slightly, the timelines of the Protagonist, Neil, Cat, and Sator, and see how each one interacts and plays off of each other, both in inverted time and in regular time, all you can do is appreciate the brilliance of Christopher Nolan. Coupled by a chilling soundtrack and gorgeous filmmaking (as usual), 'Tenet' deserves so much more than the ridicule it is receiving. Only because of the extent of the complexity am I giving 'Tenet' an 8/10. But my goodness, how talented is Christopher Nolan?'Tenet' is not for the faint of heart."
" Necessary to watch twice, preferably with subtitles. Original Review 28/8/2020
",Ashraile,8,16 September 2021,"It's somewhat ironic that a movie about time travel can't be reviewed properly until your future self rewatches the movie.It's bold of Nolan to make such a thoroughly dense blockbuster. He assumes people will actually want to see Tenet more than once so they can understand it properly, which some may not. This movie makes the chronology of Inception look as simplistic as tic-tac-toe.Ergo, it's hard for me to give an accurate rating, without having seen it twice, as I'm still trying to figure out whether everything does indeed make sense. If it does, this movie is easily a 9 or a 10. If it doesn't, it's a 6.It's further not helped by the fact that the dialogue in the first 15 minutes of the movie is painfully hard to understand / hear. Either they were behind masks; they were practically mumbling; the sound effects were too loud; or all of the above. The exposition scenes are also wayyy too brief for something this complex -- a problem also shared with Interstellar actually.(Interstellar had this minimalist exposition problem explaining Blight, where if you weren't careful, you'd miss this one sentence / scene in the entire movie explaining that Blight was a viral bacteria:""Earth's atmosphere is 80% nitrogen, we don't even breathe nitrogen. Blight does, and as it thrives, our air gets less and less oxygen"").I guess it's a Nolan quirk. Hopefully, a revision of the film audio sorts the sound mixing out. I do like the soundtrack, but it's too loud initially.I liked all the actors. You think John Washington can't act at first, but he can, and he grows on you as the film progresses. And Pattinson is his usual charming self. Elizabeth is a surprise treat. And so on.It's worth a watch either way. See it with subtitles if you can. And definitely don't expect to fully understand what's going on the first time around."
" Too much effort required to understand
",thelcar-25668,2,15 September 2021,I invested about 1 hour in this 2.5 hour film before I turned it off. I found it impossible to invest myself into this endless inexplicable maze. I was unable to identify with the characters or to follow the plot. I believe a film should either be entertaining or uplifting. This was neither. Nolan's previous film efforts were far superior.
" Big fan of Nolan but this movie is a lost cause
",nalindra-ferdinando,7,14 September 2021,Maybe the concept here is suppose to be great but with muddled dialogues and confusing chaotic story line still can't make sense of this. Some great action for sure.
" A Brilliant Film
",deager,9,13 September 2021,"Think of using the old Abbot & Costello bit of ""Who's On First"" as a way to explain the space time continuum. And then take that idea, boil it down a bit to a James Bond style thriller to save the world from WW3 that is happening in the future (add a mother and her child as a side plot to boot) throw in art theft, plane crash, moles within the secrete service or maybe not, transference of time with a character catching up with himself leaving as he is arriving and various other bits of fun then you have this extremely entertaining, often confusing, but ultimately understandable, brilliant nonlinear movie from the master of such movies himself, Christopher Nolan.If you listen and pay attention at the beginning when we have our hero, John David Washington in discussion with the head of the Indian industrialist.(as well as other things), Priya - Dimple Kapadia, explaining where the bullets from the future are coming from you will get a sense of the premise of the whole thing. Reverse Chronology.This movie requires your utmost attention, your openness, your ability to listen. All is explained and there are clues along the way. The acting is superb. Washington and Robert Patterson have great chemistry, friends who do not trust each other but would go in harms way for each other. I found the storyline with Andrew Sator, played with the utmost evilness by Kenneth Branagh, and his captive, beautiful wife Kat, played with defiant fear by Elizabeth Debicki to be the weaker part of the plot, even if necessary to the overall story. However it does lead to a most satisfying conclusion.Yes it might take two watching's to grasp it all, but it is worth every minute. One of the best movies to come along in a long time. Nolan never loses sight of what he is about, nor control of the story. He knows exactly where he is going and how to get there. The script takes us on a wild journey of time out of wack, megalomania, saving the world from a war that is to be. Each actor brings their A game, committed to the story and the telling. Give it the time it deserves. You won't be sorry."
" Absolutely
",IWasKnownAsThe1SentenceReviewer,9,13 September 2021,"Absolutely impressive and so fun to watch several times (after seeing the movie a few times, the 'reversed acting' shows a bit but is still so amazing)"
" Brilliant
",ruchitachani,10,13 September 2021,I know it's a confusing movie but by all means it's brilliant. The direction is mund blowing and so is the story.
" Yawn
",rupertwalker,4,12 September 2021,"Backwards yawn.Pretentious without substance, this is obvious by the sound mix needing to overwhelm, rather than the story having its own merit.Stupid premise (I'm a big sci-fi fan FYI), pointless titillation, a stale process, with a paint-by-numbers villain whose motives are never fully established.Watch this if you want to say to your friends you understand a pile of garbage but without admitting or realising it's garbage. 'Understanding' this is the equivalent of giving a child a gold star for merely finished their homework they're meant to do.Artists have a bad streak, and this is certainly one of them. I get the distinct impression many involved in production were simply 'Yes Men' and didn't want to view anything critically, lest they be scorned for criticising a beloved Director. High review scores from critics yet again reinforces that the whole review industry at large is a revolving door where friends mustn't criticise friends."
