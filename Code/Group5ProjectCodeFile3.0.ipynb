      "Tenet is a cinematic masterpiece that takes you on an exciting and surprising journey through time and space. From the first scene you are immersed in a world of intrigue and danger that keeps you in suspense throughout the film. Be told. The action sequences are really good and the visual effects are great.The cast is phenomenal with John David Washington giving an outstanding performance in the lead role. Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki also excel in their respective roles bringing depth and nuance to their characters.But what sets Tenet apart is his sheer ambition. This is a movie that demands your full attention and rewards you for it. Challenge.In short Tenet is a love letter to cinema an exhilarating ride that pushes the boundaries of what is possible on screen. If you're looking for a breathtaking film that keeps you pondering its mysteries long after the credits roll look no further than Tenet.\n",

      "Putting aside the ham-handed effort to explain the physics which was unavoidable since it's clear no physicist was ever asked to look at the plausibility of the script the overall premise wasn't awful. The first 30-45 minutes quite muddled the premise by trying to create suspense where there was no need for any yet; choosing to open with a James Bond spy ambience was the wrong choice. And oddly in the end the very premise itself completely eliminated any suspense in the ending because we knew the world wasn't going to be deleted so we knew almost to the smallest detail what was going to happen. That's not really a failure on this movie's fault; such circuitous and \"destiny\" oriented premises always run that risk. With such premises you need to look for suspense in some fashion other than the question of whether destiny is real or not. The \"destroy everything or nothing\" premise could not be the key suspense point. If for example they'd focused the critical ending question of where the protagonist and the girl would get together they'd have posed a question that could go either way ... and therefore been suspenseful. I've only ever seen one \"end of the world\" movie where focus successfully stayed on whether the world would end or not ... and surprisingly it did ... and then more surprisingly it didn't.Clearly a WHOLE lot of effort was put into thinking through the visual implications of forward/backward time travel. Some very inventive chase and fight scenes and especially seeing the same sequences played out first in forward time and then again later in reverse time. A huge scripting effort and an even greater monumental continuity effort. Unfortunately as one might expect for a task this large and complex there were quite a few perspective failures. But perhaps the greatest failure was in audio. Faces covered in masks perhaps a bit stupid overkill-one asks why air needed to be reversed when literally nothing else in the forward world needed to be are fine visualizations but in a movie this fast paced all I can say is I'm damned glad I streamed it so I could go back over and over again: in a theater mumbled clues to a complex story like this is the same thing as not bother to explain anything. People can't concentrate the necessary effort for two hours on hearing listening and understanding without getting migraines. The movie was clearly not shown to anyone not already familiar with the premise before editing was complete. The movie would gone up 2 ratings on IMDB if people had actually heard and understood the details of the premise and its implications but alas far too many reviews were posted here by people who either couldn't spend the effort to understand or wouldn't.Any time you combine a frenzied presentation with a complex premise like time travel with no meaningful opportunity to pause and think you're just going to lose your audience along the way. And while there were a huge number of time-travel nuances in the closing scenes I wager most people missed at least half of them.Perhaps I'm a bit of an elitist in thinking I did get them and many others didn't but that's not exactly the way to maximize your profits making a movie.\n",

      "I have to admit crashing a real plane with practical effects was a highlight but this doesn't make \"Tenet\" a good action movie. I'd say it's Nolands worst project since this film tries so hard to be unique it gets lost in the sands of its own time. When \"Tenet\" was released in 2020 everybody was hyped about the way how the reverse footage was shot. This is interesting but doesn't look convincing all the time. The fight at the airport is tedious and unwillingly funny especially when the SWAT like guys are crawling backwards on the floor making funny shoe noises like they played basketball on the school court. The first hour goes by fast and so much happens in this time yet little I did understand. They keep talking too much too fast and Blondie is whispering when she is the one spreading important clues. Nolan fails to star the \"Protagonist\" in a likeable way and therefor the film just presses on without any connection to the lead. Robert Pattinson did a nice job as his sidekick Neil and I am so looking forward to see him starring the \"Batman\". Oops I lost it there. Yeah Tenet is a waste of your precious watching time.\n",

      "Although this was victimized by COVID even after an impressive pre-release marketing campaign the film is just not that good. A classic B-movie with an A-level budget frenetic bordering on incoherent editing and a silly spin on searching for horcruxes reference intended the moebius strip time spin just didn't really work. Maybe the bonding agents are on the editing room floor somewhere but I'm sure the book not based on the movie is much for fulfilling and illuminates the internal workings of the characters beyond \"save my child\" and \"I hate life so I'm taking everyone with me\". This is comic book level stuff for a work alleging to be of substance. The character motivations are ridiculously thin and cliched. Much of the monotone dialogue lacks punch and vitality. For all the pretension this is nothing more than smoke and mirrors.\n",

      "Tenet is a sci-fi action film directed by Christopher Nolan that revolves around a secret agent who uses time inversion to prevent a global catastrophe. The film is a dazzling display of Nolan's signature style featuring stunning visuals complex plot twists and thrilling action sequences. The film also explores themes of free will fate and entropy. John David Washington leads the cast as the Protagonist a charismatic and skilled spy who teams up with Neil Robert Pattinson a mysterious ally. Kenneth Branagh plays Andrei Sator a ruthless Russian oligarch who seeks to destroy the world.I enjoyed Tenet for its ambitious and original concept its impressive cinematography its exhilarating pace and its clever dialogue. I think Christopher Nolan delivered another masterpiece that challenges and entertains the audience. I would recommend Tenet to fans of sci-fi who appreciate a fast-paced and intricate film that requires multiple viewings to fully understand.\n",

      "My only regret was not watching this in the theatres. Well streaming this has its own advantages like you can rewind and watch the specific scene's \"before and after.\" I find that most of the bad reviews talk about the plot and while I agree that the plot will be confusing for a majority of the people but once you get a grasp of it you will awe and appreciate this even more. Even the soundtrack was just perfect for this movie I'm actually glad that Nolan didn't use Zimmer for this project because his style wasn't suitable. While the action sequences are decent I'd recommend this movie for its story and plot because I myself enjoys a good intricate mystery/thriller stuffs. Nolan is truly one of the best of our time.\n",

The time inversion aspect of the film was so interesting and different; I've never seen anything like it in another film. You will probably be confused throughout the movie but by the end everything comes together. I like how the characters were portrayed and written but one thing I felt this movie was lacking was a solid antagonist. I love this film it's mind-blowing gripping and thought-provoking and I would highly recommend it.\n",

      "A film will discover both fans and those who will enjoy less. Nolan is trying to apply the ideas we saw in his previous fantastic filmsbut also discovered something new - what is worth seeing in cinema and seeing more than once at home. Without telling the story of the filmone can only ask questions - what if onr way or another ? So the film is kind of divided into two parts. It is necessary and possible to watch from the very first minutes and you will get into the story perfectly. Fun to see know or lesser known actors becouse in the movie a lot of actionwell that charisma was even more.

      "The concept behind Tenet is a very interesting one but also very difficult to implement in a movie and probably even more important vaguely explained and expanded upon throughout the runtime. That last bit is probably its downfall stated rules that govern its function aren't consistently abided by making the whole adventure sketchy at best.Acting was good action scenes were interesting the story could've been solid if the whole time-traveling mechanic would've been treated in a more traditional manner.It may not have ended up being a high concept sci-fi movie but it would've been a more consistent and overall ejoyable long yeah a bit too long maybe? cinematic experience.Worth the watch but it may require of you to fill in a lot of blanks that the writers and technology left within it.\n",

      "Christopher Nolan's filmography has in my view a registered position in the history of cinema; however with this movie Nolan cannot carry himself further when we compare Tenet with his former works most of which had box office-recorded movies.There is an unique idea about \"time inverting\" but the idea is not fit on the action based story which has full of cliches. Concept of inverting can be easy to understand from the perspective of Nolan undoubtedly but I'm sure that audience may have difficulty to understand the idea scene by scene upon the actions of the characters or from the story because action genre has fast-paced storytelling; nonetheless you can get the idea and what Nolan is trying to say in general. So I agree with some critics saying that Nolan made this movie just for himself.Besides background of the characters are empty unfortunately. You cannot feel empathy for the protagonist or cannot understand the motivation of some characters to a certain extent but performances of actresses  actors quite well - especially John David Washington.From cinematographic and musical perspectives the movie makes real the atmosphere and the world. For the last five years Hoyte Van Hoytema DP and Ludwig Göransson composer have the names proved themselves in their professions and they deserve some credits specifically for this movie.Although Tenet has full of bad criticism according to a stereotypical action based movie you can feel the magical and dazzling touch of a master director with an idea that wasn't thought before. Therefore the movie deserves to be watched  a score above average.TRIVIA: Contains no green screens just practical effects. This includes the inversion sequences for which director Christopher Nolan chose instead to shoot each scene twice: one time moving forward and once with the actors doing everything backward.

None of the characters are remotely interesting much of the dialogue is inaudible and the ridiculous convolutions add up to nothing.

I think it had the makings of a very good file if the casting had been different in the main roles. This turned out to be just a mess. I got to the point that I just couldn't watch it any further and turned it off. Could have been much better with some more experienced actors anda better script.

That or we just have to accept that he is mad or the future people told him it was the only way. He does it because he is dying and his madness makes him think if he can't live then no one else can either - or something. It is not clear which so pick'n'mix as you like. Time travel movies never work. Never. Basically it's an excuse for a lot of Bond style fist fights explosions crashes car chases random violence. As with Bond the baddie has an unending supply of incredibly gullible and stupid helpers all over the world who are quite happy to be killed and maimed on his behalf and set off these devices on command from the baddie as he lounges on his mega-yacht.

When at a first sight you can see the final result: a protagonist without personality scenes plenty of unnecessary violence excess of special effects and at last an clumsy attempt to make up the mediocrity of the film using some well known actors with no results. I can accept mister Nolan isa very distinguished director.

How the heck did Meister Nolan get this past the producers? Not that I'm complaining. It truly is a great great film. It's just...that it defies all logic. Is Christopher Nolan from the future? I was intrigued to note there is a reference to Oppenheimer in the film and as we no know Nolan is making / has been making a bio-pic about Oppenheimer. Or is that statement a spolier? Is a spolier a spolier if it's written in the future about the past? Or is it - is a spolier a spolier if it's written in the past about the future? My head hurts...for all the right reasons.

      "This summer in anticipation of the release of Tenet I wrote a piece defending the position of Christopher Nolan as not merely a filmmaker of huge commercial clout but as someone whose quality of work on an artistic cinematographic and emotional yes I wrote that level merits proper appreciation too. I did post a warning though that Nolan's increasing reverence for tech and his control freak tendencies were threatening to outweigh that lovely dichotomy he had always been able to blend between all things genre and his metaphysically-inflected narratives.With Tenet Nolan totally oversteps that line and has turned in a work that runs dangerously close to self-satire. While I would argue his previous ten films have always possessed some portion of an emotional edge amid the viscerality of their storytelling Tenet is simply a spectatorial dead weight. It is completely lacking in tension and is just a film endlessly stuck in the cycle of explaining and justifying itself and its conceit perhaps an unintended ironic echo of its central theme of inversion. Copious exposition is nothing new to a Nolan film but comprehensiblity and an emotional core always co-existed with that philosophical bent. Even Memento - a film which loosely echoes the tricks of Tenet with a focus on a narrative being played in reverse - was able to conjure three-dimensional character arcs out of those thematics. In Tenet however the characters remain unintentionally flat which is borne out when the Protagonist's climactic conversation with Neil and his one last look at Kat don't carry the dramatic pay-off Nolan is clearly angling for.Even in Nolan's lesser guise as a purveyor of spectacle Tenet falls flat. For all the lustre gravitas and awe Nolan applies to his action sequences I'm thinking about the exploding jumbo the billionaire's yacht the racing boats he's unable to aestheticise these for his audience the way his idol Michael Mann can. It's because Mann's action scenes are always connected to the ethics and emotion of his stories whereas Nolan's function as extraneous gorging on extreme financial technological and industrial might.\n",

      "Ok I had to watch Inception about 3 times to uh get it. You'll have to watch this one about five. The concept is mind-blowing with the whole inversion of time and reversed entropy through the continium or...something like that. Basically folks in the future have figured out how to send something traveling backwards through time. So future bullets that have already been fired are sent spiraling backwards and end up back in the magazine of the gun someone is holding before they've even fired it. If that sounds complicated just wait till cars and humans start going backwards. The complex part is when they all start meeting themselves and the plot folds and unfolds...is revisited...is changed...is observed by their other selves just across the battlefield...etc. Etc. Etc...you get the picture. All the while our hero who is not named and is just referred to as the 'Protagonist' is trying to thwart this dangerous technology which has obviously ended up in the wrong hands from destroying the world. Not by sending a nuke back into the hands of Hitler and the SS but even worse; Using some kinda complicated math algorithm to create a doomsday bomb. Or at least I THINK that's what he was doing. I tried to tell my 9th grade Calculus teacher that not only was math useless turns out IT's DANGEROUSAnyhow the acting is great. The lead guy does good. Robert Pattinson from Twilight fame is the lead character's uh...side-kick and he does just fine. Elizabeth Dibicki does great as the...well it's complicated. You'll just have to watch and figure it out for yourself. The truth is you could say that about most of this movie. The plot is so complex and quick-moving that we found ourselves rewinding many times to review a line here and there that was important to what was going on. I think I'm a fairly smart guy I have a doctorate and even an undergrad bachelor of science degree. I have even written a sci-fi book so I thought I would 'get it' maybe a little better than the average fella walking through Walmart that works as an auto mechanic no offense to that line of work but even I felt myself raising an eyebrow many times while watching this movie. It's so confusing at times that I even asked my bunch; \"How many average folks would have turned this off by now?\"It's not to say that it isn't entertaining. It's definitely original and the special effects are beyond mind-blowing and it redefines the phrase \"plot twists\"So give it a try and be prepared to plan on watching again and maybe again. Grab a plate of chocolate chip cookies and pull up a sofa by the fire on a weekend night with the fam when you got nothing stressful on your mind to distract you. You'll definitely need a clear head to try and navigate through this one.Enjoy....\n",

      "I'm honestly baffled how could a director with an incredible debut like Memento go so far down his own rabbit holes.Plot - pretty original and very cool concepts but so poorly executed. Whatever works in this movie is quickly ruined by exposition.Pacing - too much action too much dialogue you keep missing because of loud music and too much noise. They tried to cram so much stuff in two and a half hours and this movie could easily do without half of its content.Dialogue - there are no characters in this movie. The only purpose of every character is to tell you where the plot is going just in case you were too stupid to figure it out. So there's no dialogue really. Just Nolan holding the viewer's hand through this mess of a movie through different characters. So when the characters speak to each other it feels like you're watching the director's commentary rather than an actual movie.Acting - both Pattinson and Michael Caine are wasted here. Washington doesn't have a character. His character doesn't even have a name he is called \"The Protagonist\" and the big plot twist of this movie is that he IS in fact THE PROTAGONIST. Bravo Nolan Kenneth Brannagh plays every Russian villain you've ever seen in campy 80s and 90s action movies. He is the worst thing about this movie in my opinion. If they hired someone better to play Sator I would've at least had some motivation to sit through the movie. It's not most of the actors' fault that they don't have actual characters to work with but Kenneth Brannagh really screws this up.The ol' switcheroo of continuity - the entire second half of this movie is just one big continuity error. This is probably the most unforgivable crime that this movie commits. Nolan seems to just switch the reversal of time on and off to make this contrived plot work. You see the entire world supposedly go into reverse but all of the characters are moving forwards in time so you can follow the actual plot even the ones that aren't \"inverted\". If they really committed to the time reversal it would've been beautiful but no... characters keep \"inverting\" themselves for the sake of comprehensive storytelling. You watch the movie then you get confused by something that doesn't make sense and a character appears not a second later to tell you \"ah you see... I inverted myself back then... so now I'm dead but actually I was dead...\" Yeah sure... You really wanna blow us away Nolan? Don't do a half-assed attempt at time-reversal where everybody talks and walks normal. Make the second half actually reversed... It would've been way better to be confusing rather than just pretending to be clever. The movie explicitly tells you \"don't try to understand it\" and then feels the need to keep explaining itself to you for two hours... In its best moments this movie had no exposition. If Nolan lets things just happen without any pointless explanation I think his movies would've been way better than they are.\n",

      "Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly a great filmmaker although personally I find his films very hit and miss - The Dark Knight is outstanding and even played as a straight cops and robbers movie instead of a superhero film that still stands. Likewise with The Prestige another simply perfect film. On the flip side of that he gives us say Dunkirk which for me was more than disappointing. Anyway Tenet falls smack back in the middle. It's not a masterclass in filmmaking nor is it disappointing. It looks incredible and it's action packed and full of the trucks you'd expect from a Nolan film. However it's just too convoluted and hard to follow. It's a bit too clever for its own good which sometimes can be a good thing but to most casual viewers it's just not worth the effort. I have watched it 3 times now and I admit it gets better with each viewing but you probably shouldn't need to watch something half a dozen times to fully grasp the story or what's going on. If you struggled with Inception then seriously give Tenet a miss it'll just leave you with a headache. If you want to watch it to be dazzled by jaw dropping set pieces then give it a go. It's not a bad film it just pushes filmmaking to new limits which isn't a bad thing.On a footnote it would be interesting to see what Nolan could do if he was given the opportunity to helm a Bond movie because there's possibly no-one better at action sequences around right now.\n",

      "The idea is great the plot points should work for most people - but it's told in a too confusing way. And I love complex stories This just wasn't written very well. The special effects were great of course but the heroes goal was missing and the reason why we should care for him. It was all too confusing - I couldn't remember the characters or their stories I didn't get most of the connections ... and that's coming from someone who loved a truly complex story like Dark. What looked extremely promising turned out quite boring - my husband fell asleep at the end because he couldn't follow anyway anymore. I say it's worth a watch - because the idea was great after all.\n",

      "Christopher Nolan's films always delight with their ideas the quality of the films and this film is no exception. But the film has its pluses and minuses in every moment.The main thing on which the film is built is made qualitatively and difficult but the explanation of this chip lasts almost the entire film. The whole main plot is built on this concept which can't be called a minus but also can't be a plus. The characters are not revealed but the main characters are memorable. The special effects the only thing remain unqualified because Nolan prefers to recreate them live.It's a good movie to watch. Interesting action a concept that you see for the first time in movies exactly like this.\n",

      "Tenet really wants to be a complex movie which feels like something you can not understand. And this kind of overwhelming story works. But to be honest it doesn't work to me.It's not really complex...you just can't understand what is going on because the scenes are switching so fast you are always busy to follow it.At least the characters are not overwhelming. But in favor they are boring. You can not feel with them or see any progress they are going threw. They are just random characters who you will forget if you are rewatching tenet in the future.But also it is really interesting to watch and challenging your mind. Can you follow the story the first time you are watching tenet? Maybe yes or maybe not. It doesn't matter because it is not a movie you should understand and this is what makes it complicated and not complex...even if tenet wants to be complicated. After the first time you haved watched tenet there is nothing you can think about and just your aha-moment of understanding what the heck was going on the last two hours.\n",

      "I am a loyal fan of director Nolan. I have watched and enjoyed every film of his without exception. I think he is the director who really understands the art of film. For this film I call it the feast of vision because I am really affected by every shot of it. Every shot every picture and every frame are individually captured as a work of art. In terms of the overall picture environment this is the only work I feel comfortable with. In other words I want you to watch it again. This is a very difficult thing for a science fiction film And the director did it which really made me very happy. The above is my feeling from the perspective of direct sense. Next let's talk about the plot. As usual I don't talk about the details. I admit that I may be a little stupid. When I saw the film for the first time I didn't see the specific content of the story. The specific story is really a little complicated but one thing is worth affirming. Although the story is complex and difficult But there are no films with complex plots which annoy the audience. After seeing them they will never watch them for the second time. But this film is different. After watching it for the first time you can't understand it. You will be eager to see it for the second time and the third time until you understand it. It is like a strong magnetic magnet which has always attracted you to explore it. I especially admire the director's thinking ability. I have seen AI before It was the first time I was attracted by him. After so long and watching so many films I am very honest to tell you that he has not changed. This film also provided me with great inspiration in the creative process. The expression of \"transformation\" and the very artistic treatment also provided me with a lot of good help.\n",
